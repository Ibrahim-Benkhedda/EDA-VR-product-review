0,Present for daughter,I bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter very happy with the delivery ewas delivered with care.,2022-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Mandy, 45 - 54, Prescot"
1,Meta Quest 2,Excellent value for money. Happy customer would definitely recommend,2022-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Racka, 45 - 54, Teesside"
2,Meta quest 2,The best thing I've ever brought and owned. Love playing the games so much fun,2022-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Mick, 35 - 44, Mansfield"
3,Awesome headset,"This is the first VR headset I have ever owned but both me and my partner are very impressed with it. So delighted that it also has a glasses spacer included. Overall I'm really impressed with it. Please be aware that if using with a PC you can only have 1 active monitor whilst using it otherwise the headset will have a glitchy connection and the visuals around you are distorted, laggy and it almost looks like you're surrounded by a warping void whilst wearing the headset. Turning off one of my 2 monitors hasn't worked so I'm yet to fix that by trying to completely disconnect the secondary monitor. The one con I have to mention is that it seems to be sliding forward quite a bit which can be disruptive to the game play and I'm considering purchasing the elite strap (potentially the one with a battery to balance the weight of it a bit).",2022-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Denisa, 25 - 34, Bristol"
4,So much fun,I bought this for my 13 year old nephews birthday and it was so easy to set up and start using. We set up the meta account in just a few mins and bought some games at the same time. The whole family tried it and it was so much fun and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this for anyone even a non gamer like me! The only problem is we had to keep charging it but that may be because we couldn’t wait until it was fully charged to start using it.,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Suesmillai, 45 - 54, Bookham"
5,Another World,"This was an impulse buy after playing with one at our friends house, thought ‘will we use it? Well, we haven’t put it down since we brought it home. Oh what fun, absolutely love it! What an amazing gadget, virtual reality, who would have thought it would be this good! Love love love!",2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"SmileyKaz, 45 - 54, Edinburgh"
6,Ex value,Kids love it ex value,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Sandra, 55 - 64, Carrickfergus"
7,Would not Set up,I returned ours. After setting up Facebook accounts and Meta accounts we had to pair phone to headset. It connected itself by bluetooth during the set up process but kept asking for a code after I put my credit card in. By then the code wasn't displayed but we remembered it. When we put it in it said already paired try again. We gave up. It says easy to set up on the box. Shame but bought a Pico4 instead which is much better,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Nottyash, 45 - 54, Scarborough"

14,Vr,Can't give an honest review other than it was expensive to purchase and it's a Xmas gift wich is still sealed in its box because if i undo it I can't return if my kid decides it don't want it so i have to wait till Xmas day to leave a proper review,2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Jacquie, 45 - 54, Plumstead"

21,Great purchase,"Bought for sons 12th birthday, he loves it. Would make an ideal Christmas present",2022-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"C_tatey, 35 - 44, Durham"

24,Meta headset,I purchased this for my daughters birthday. Amazing unit first class service from Argos berryden Aberdeen.,2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Mike251070, 45 - 54, Aberdeen"
25,"Some amazing points, some not so good.","Overall, pleased. It has some great games, the new Iron Man VR, although predictable is enjoyable. Vader Immortal is also great. Headstraps are OK, but you can add better aftermarket straps. Battery life is only a couple of hours, however that's as much as I can take before motion sickness kicks in. Again, this can be supplemented by additional battery packs, or by wearing while plugged in. Has the ability to put down controllers and sense your hands, which is great to see, although not as functional as the handsets. Better than the old, stick a phone in a box trick. It has passthrough which is a grainy black and white, so not suitable for any form of hybrid viewing other than basic orientation. Does come with speakers positioned just by the ears which are adequate, although maybe irritating for others in the room.",2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Martin, 35 - 44, Birmingham, West midlands"
26,Great buy,Bought for my son’s 10th birthday. He’s over the moon with his present,2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Heating Point, 35 - 44, London"

29,Meta quest 2,I got this for my son birthday he loves it! Family fun,2022-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Kay, 35 - 44, West Yorkshire"
30,Amazing,The Meta quest 2 is just amazing. Love it. I did get a different head strap though as the elastic one can be awkward to adjust. But this thing is incredible.,2022-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Al, 45 - 54, Kent"
31,Amazing,I bought this for my sons 10th birthday.. I have 1 very happy boy. Was overwhelmed with it. Easy to use and set up. Graphics are awsome,2022-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Miss Happy, 45 - 54, Essex"

35,Awesome!,"This is a cool little device. I bought it since my computer isn’t fully VR ready yet so it’s perfect! I would recommend, if you’re new to VR like me, to be aware you’ll need regular breaks since you will get dizzy and motion sickness. Also, start off sitting until you have gotten used to it. Overall great device!!",2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"J, 35 - 44, Uk"
36,What he wanted for Xmas,Bought for Xmas present for Grandson do not know anything about it,2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Gran, 65 or over"
37,Exceeded all my expectations,I bought this for cinema style entertainment but the full VR experiences and 360 degree vidoes are amazing and there is no much free content. As a standalone unit I think this is a really good entertainment system and far more immersive than I realised.,2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"jo, 45 - 54, East Anglia"
38,occulus/meta quest 2,so happy we got this used by whole.family expensive but worth it absolutely whether for games education movies or whatever there really is something for everyone,2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"david, 35 - 44, cornwall"

42,Meta quest 2,"Recently bought this item, quality is amazing. However not as big of games range as u thought, a lot are videos! Definitely say the age range is 10+ maybe older as I bought this for my son and without wearing the headset we haven’t a clue how to help him. Although it’s fantastic graphics and overall a great gadget/gaming console I wish we waited a few years as not used like I thought he would and the head piece can be rather uncomfortable.",2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Chantelle, 25 - 34, South yorkshire"
43,Great graphics,Fantastic product. Definitely keeps you fit .,2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Jagob, 35 - 44, Irvine"
44,Game changer for my Autistic Son,"My son has wanted one for over a year, but the lack of a powerful graphics card in his PC, limited his options. We decided on this as it was a stand alone option, and he loves it. Can amerce himself out of the real world and regulate his emotions. Shame its so expensive!",2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"JRAY, 45 - 54, Surrey"
45,Incredible tech,I was apprehensive about buying this as I thought it might be something I use a couple of times then put down and never use again. I was wrong. I use it every day. It’s a completely different way to play games and socialise. Careful though - I have found certain games and experiences give me motion sickness and eye strain over prolonged use. Also the battery life is terrible so you will be charging it a lot. Don’t let those things put you off though as it really is an amazing bit of kit.,2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Stumanji, 35 - 44, Stoke-on-Trent"
46,Decent VR in a portable package!,"Having been interacting with VR since the launch of the original Oculus, I found this to be a wonderful way to introduce VR to people. Heading out away from home, a unit that is not tethered to a PC, while not as an amazing an experience, does more than well enough to demonstrate VR! Decent battery life, good tracking, its hard to go wrong.",2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Kerry, 25 - 34, Enfield"

54,Amazing vr headset,I purchased this headset to mainly play vr games through my PC. It handles that task very well (though you will need to connect to your pc via a long cable) I'm really impressed with playing games through the headset itself without the need for a PC. Great battery life too for the amount of processing required for these games.,2022-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Andrew P, 35 - 44, Rugby"

64,Decent headset,Loved it. Good fun. Good fun.,2022-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Bob27, 25 - 34, Wiltshire"
65,Best gaming experience in years,After seeing a buddies Valve Index and trying out other VR headsets I took a risk and ordered the Quest2 - what a great decision - being able to play native stand alone oculus games (some of which are stunning) without having to connect to a PC is worth the asking price on its own - connect wirelessly to the PC and the wow factor kicks in - DCS / Star Wars Squadrons / Elite Dangerous / Project Cars 3 / Dirt Rally 2 and RaceRoom are all awesome add to that access to play Half Life Alyx and other Steam VR games and this becomes the greatest thing since wide screen monitors - resolution is about the same as the index (FOV narrower) but it does not matter as this is great value and I will not hesitate to recommend it - buying/installing games on the quest is easy - connecting to a PC (needs to be able to run Steam VR well) again is easy and the sense of being there is awesome. The only gripe is the rubbish strap it comes with - invest in something like the BOVOVR PRO2 and its very comfortable for hours.,2022-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Deckard64, 55 - 64, Woking, Surrey, UK"

70,Can’t say.,"I bought this as I had read many reviews and various reports stating that it can be beneficial for sufferers of dementia.

74,Amazing entertainment device for games and movies,"Once I had downloaded some apps and a few games, I was able to quickly learn how to use the device to its potential. The instructions are not very helpful and you have to learn how to use many features through experimentation and looking at blogs for the Quest 2. The Warplanes flight games are amazing and so are movies on netflix and amazon prime (although the prime app crashes sometimes). It is cool that you can link apple headphones through bluetooth and Amazon sells a cheaper clone charging cable that lets ths headset charge whist you use it. I wish I had bought the 256 gb model :(",2022-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"shark1691, 45 - 54, Herts"

80,Amazing technology..Mind blowing,I love this Quest 2 VR as the graphics are amazing. There is so much to do for all the family or just for yourself. Blown away by the games and experiences you can have. If you loved Quest 1 then this is a must have. Lighter headset and batteries last longer too.

93,Versatile VR experience,"The Quest 2 is a well designed VR headset that has the versatility to work as standalone, or connected to a PC for a wider choice of games (if the pc is up to it!). The choice of games is good and growing all the time, just search the Oculus store and you can have a look before purchasing. Don't expect cutting edge visuals in standalone mode, its essentially mobile phone hardware powering the displays. But it gives the VR experience at around half the price of some of the other VR technologies, and without having to have a high spec gaming PC. Being standalone its great to travel with, just draw out the play area and you're good to go. It works really well as a ""party game"", cast the display to a TV and everyone can see whats on the headset getting everyone involved in the fun. I'd recommend an alternative strap such as the elite strap or similar for a more comfortable experience.",2022-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"User, 25 - 34"

98,Loved it,"I bought this a little while ago and have been trying it out ever since and i can say it was worth the money. You are spoilt for choice with games and apps, although most you have to pay for. Saying that there are a few free apps like vr chat and a few others to keep you going.",2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Reidwene, 45 - 54, Southend-on-Sea, Essex"

101,Play video games and get a workout,"Play video games and get a workout. This is excellent technology and a great way of experience video games in a different dimension. If you get used to the motion of the screen in front of you then you enjoy your moment in this technology and have a great experience. Pass you get the added benefit of getting a workout, Doing an hour on beat Saber really get you into a sweat and get your heart pumping. I love using mine and have used it almost every day since having it, even meeting up with friends in virtual rooms and chatting and it’s like them being right in front of you.",2022-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Devondice, 35 - 44, Plymouth"

103,A whole new world,"Wow! I'm absolutely delighted with this device. I bought it primarily for flight simulator to connect to my pc and although I really need to upgrade my pc to cope with it, I just can't go back to a flat screen now! If you don't want to use it with a pc it will work very nicely on it's own connected to WiFi and there are hundreds of games movies and apps available for it, including some fun free stuff. I would say that the standard strap is really uncomfortable but there are others available. I also bought the elite headstrap with battery which is a bit expensive but is much better than standard and doubles the time you can use it between charges.",2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"NigelH, 55 - 64, Peacehaven"
104,A brilliant vr experience,"Bought this to fill time in on my holidays and very happy i bought it. Some great titles avilable.. I like that theres no cable needed which is miles better than the earlier Rift. And while it can be attached to a PC for PCVR, its strength is in its own titles.. The only downer, the price went up £100.. But thats my choice to buy or not.",2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Davez, 55 - 64, Sunderland"

106,Best VR Headset for Money,"I am very glad that I decided to buy the Quest 2, it has allowed me to play VR games at a far more affordable price and it has fantastic visual quality for a wireless headset.

110,Great value VR,Managed to pick this up before the price hike. High quality VR with little effort for standalone and VRPC. The only downside being the headstrap and battery life,2022-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"JC, 25 - 34, Kettering"

112,Amazing Experience,"I'm 68 and this my first VR experience. Wow I absolutely love it. I play Synth Riders each day which is so much fun it doesn't feel like exercise. With Wander I got back to Munich walking along the streets. Brink is great to see mountains, canyons and other landscapes where I feel giddy when I think I'm about to fall of a mountain lol. I can't believe how real it all feels as though you are actually in that place. There are so many more things to experience with the Quest but I haven't got around to trying them all out yet. All in all I'm so glad I purchased this and expect to have many more hours of enjoyment with it.",2022-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Trish, 65 or over, Dunfermline"

114,Amazing little piece of technology,"I bought this about a month ago and, I'm really not a gamer, but I needed to start doing some exercise which I hate.

117,Amazing VR set,I bought this as a gift for my son and it was hard to get my head around the fact this is a stand alone product so no console is needed to play it but it works straight out of the box and you need to download an app onto your phone to use it but you can stream the video so you can watch as someone plays. You do need a Facebook account to get started but I linked this to my own account as my 12yr old doesn't have Facebook.,2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"NottsL, 35 - 44, Hucknall"
118,Oculus,Pleased I could pick up straight away. Enjoy playing this and bought a few games. Like that my lorry driving game can link onto this.,2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Chris, 45 - 54, County Durham"

120,Really Fun,It is so much fun and lots of stuff to do,2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"TjtheDj, 35 - 44"
121,Best VR currently available,"I'm blown away by VR as watching videos on people using it on screen cannot possibly compare. After doing a lot of research this is the best overall VR currently available. My two gripes are that the battery life is relatively short between charges and the USB port to connect to a pc is placed in a weird place where you end up knocking it out while playing. Minor issues, though considering the positives.",2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"JB, 35 - 44, Crawley"
122,Absolutely amazing! So much fun!,"I bought this for my sons 10th birthday and it is used every day by kids and adults. There are some amazing games to play, some free and some that you can purchase. It keeps us entertained for hours so I'd thoroughly recommend this for any age! The only down side I'd say is the battery life for the headset, but that's to be expected with how much use it has.",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"st90, 25 - 34, Leeds"

124,Educational and fun!,"My boys saved up for a year to buy this and we’re not disappointed. They love scaring everyone with the plank walking experience. I love that they can visit places around the world. There are lots of free games but no filter to just see the free ones so worth looking for free game on another device first. New paid games we’ve got have been between £10-£20 which is much cheaper than Xbox or PS games. I love that it gets them up and actively playing rather than sitting still. It also comes with a spacer for those who wear glasses so you don’t have to remove them which was a great thoughtful touch. Finally, a piece of tech we can all agree is great!",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Sarah4Palace, 35 - 44, Surrey"
125,Awesome,This is an amazing piece of equipment it gives you the option to make a grid and if you step out of the grid your screen will come off so you can see where you are in the room. Highly recommend if you want the virtual experience.,2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Bretskii93, 25 - 34, Peterborough"

128,Great piece of kit,"Bought this for my son's birthday, bit pricey, but he loves it. Different games available to play/download. I tried it, but suffer from motion sickness, so nope - but everything seemed really good and well laid out to follow.

129,Great toy but battery not last long,+ Great graphics Reality of movement Good fun - Battery life,2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Arek, 35 - 44, Bradford"
130,It's pretty mid,"For every good thing there is a bad thing; you can bring it anywhere but it only has a two hour battery life, it's more affordable than other products but you might find yourself buying lots of attachments to it, it's easy to pack up, but the strap is super uncomfortable. Overall I would recommend this product only if you have more then enough chedda' because it's pretty much only bearable with if you buy more with it. Oh and for the love of God... DON'T BUY THE ELITE STRAP, THEY ALL BREAK WITHIN A YEAR!!!",2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Your future husband, 18 - 24"

134,Great fun!,"Thought this would be a way that the whole family could have fun, and I wasn’t wrong. It’s a strange feeling when you first put the headset on but fascinating.

140,Very robust,"I wanted to test everything out before writing a review. To begin with, the quest 2 is an amazing device with superb graphics though not as clear as watching on a screen but it is surprisingly clear. I have try some movies and YouTube and was so cool.

160,Best Bang for Your Buck!,"If you are looking to get into the world of VR, this is a great place to start. The setup is spectacularly easy, setup your Wifi and log in with your Facebook account setup a safety zone in the headset which shows you when you are leaving you're chosen safe area and you're good to go. With the ability to connect to a PC/Laptop either through a link cable (£20 ish) or using air link via the Wifi you can play a multitude of games using for example steamVR, But there is plenty of content without the need to even own a PC/Laptop. If you wear glasses, not an issue the Quest 2 comes with a spacer to help but, I have found I don't need this and my glasses don't touch the lenses in the headset (which could scratch the lenses in the headset). The headset is fairly comfortable to wear however you do need to fiddle to get the lenses in the ""sweet spot"" otherwise you get a blurry view, however once you figure it out it is easy to get the correct position within a few seconds of putting it on. There are apps for experiencining 3D movies, full 360 degree events like a music concerts, educational films, museums, historic sites, an ISS tour or even a space walk and genuinely tons more. Google Earth VR is fantastic. All in all I love the quest 2 and have no hesitation in recommending it to others looking to get into VR, at this price point it truly is great value for money, And at no point have I been dissapointed.",2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"MH, 35 - 44, East Anglia"

163,THE FUTURE,"Very impressed, the technology seems very early, the headset is way ahead of its time but it’s fantastic quality, very well built and the games are very very good, once you have used it for a while you forget about where you actually are in reality and only see the VR world, my son who it was bought for absolutely loves it",2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Danny, 35 - 44, Sheffield"

166,Honestly? Go for it!,"I have purchased this product about a month ago after reading so many reviews and product comparisons between the quest and rift and htc vive i felt more confused than ever. I decided to just go for the quest 2 as it wqs cheaper than the vive and could do just as much as the rift if i bought thr cable for it. The cabke cost about £89 however, after a little digging around i discovered the airlink feature and developer mode. Now the airlink isnt perfect, sometimes it lags , doesnt connect or is just slow, but after a restart and or reconnect? Believe me when i say this is the most versatile and capabke vr headset on the market, coming in at an amazing and affordable price as well as tools like sidequest to play experminetal games i can safelet say this is the perfect no nonsense vr headset for begginer or addicted vr users. Amazing product 11/5",2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Squob, 18 - 24, Burton upon trent"

170,Great Vision,The quality of the vision is second to none. I accept that you can buy cheaper versions but if you can afford the higher cost then go for it. You will not be disappointed.,2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Les, 65 or over, West Midlands"

177,Amazing technology,"I bought this for my son as an early birthday present. He absolutely loves it! I had a little go and I admit, the future technology is fantastic.

178,Great vr headset for the money !,"I purchased the quest 2 primarily for sim racing on pc, I got a link cable and it does exactly what I wanted it to do. The image quality is very good for the price, I am really enjoying racing in vr, I have also purchased some games from the oculus store and have been using the headset to play them also, there are some good games on the store. The stock strap isn’t great and neither is the facial interface but I got an AMVR head back padding that completely transformed the stock strap, and I also got AMVR resilient facial interface which is way more comfortable than the stock interface. Those items were definitely worth the investment, you might be lucky and find it comfortable as is, but I would expect to have to buy some extras to make it comfortable. Now I suppose I should mention the fact that you need a Facebook account to use it, I really don’t like Facebook and really wasn’t happy about the fact you must have an account to use the quest 2, but I have setup an account and locked it down so nobody can find me so it doesn’t really matter that much. All in all I am very pleased with the Quest 2, it does exactly what I want it to do and more, I have spent several hours playing it and expect to spend several more. For the price I don’t think you can beat it, I would recommend it to anybody who want’s to get into vr.",2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Mark, 45 - 54, Suffolk, UK"

181,Funky!,My son loves this and plays online with friends who also have one. There aren't many games on this at the moment but its definitely the future. I would recommend at least 10ft square of free space to use this as you can lash out or move suddenly without remembering where you really are !

188,Great VR,"Amazing VR although be prepared - everything needs to be paid for, so don’t expect to just pick up and play. You will need to pay for all games and apps - there’s maybe 2-3 free ones and a few demo’s. Still though great tech, very seamless in its functionality. Be prepared to charge it regularly. Great for teens.",2022-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Mummybear, 25 - 34, Surrey"
189,Good Quality!,"I bought this a few weeks ago and boy is it amazing! The packaging came perfectly, unopened and protected.

It was fully factory reseted and brand new from official Meta!!",2022-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"TechnoFrog, 45 - 54, Retford, Nottinghamshire"
190,Brilliant!!!,"Had the Oculus Quest 2 about 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.

203,Changed my life!,"Easy to use, comfortable to wear. I'm in my 50s, a big girl with a fat face and wear glasses. I have been using it to do dancing, exercising and tai chi and it's been fantastic. Suggest you invest in a sweat guard or a wipeable face insert if you're going to be doing anything sweaty! Also suggest if you're new to VR to buy some ginger biscuits and ginger beer to help with the initial queasiness. Go slow at first until you acclimatise. Battery is about 2-3 hours, easily plugged in. I also play games with my partner, eg Rec Room paintball. Great VR experience.",2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"andwhowantstoknow, 45 - 54, Dunfermline"
204,Exceeded expectations,"Really happy with my Quest 2, mine was still Oculus branded rather than Meta. Surprised that I could still wear my glasses while using the Quest. Make sure to add the glasses spacer though. The unit comes with a silicone protector for the foam section that sits against the face, making it more comfortable. You still get an imprint if you wear the headset for long enough. Don't plan on going out anywhere for a bit after a decent gaming session ;) Set up was easy and make sure to do the referral thing if a friend already has a Quest 2. You get some money credit for buying some apps/games. Battery life is reasonable, but if you get a 15m USB cable (for linking to a PC) you can keep yourself charged up while playing. But I'll eventually get the integrated battery pack head strap. Make sure to visit the Oculus website, plus download the Oculus app onto your mobile. The mobile app will make it easy to set up your Quest 2. Although there are instructions in the box on how to do this. Yeah, overall I'm happy with my purchase.",2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"andrew_f, 35 - 44, Castle Cary, Somerset"

218,Surprisingly Powerful,"Coming from an Oculus Rift I was concerned that there might be a huge drop off in quality as the quest is a standalone device, but I’ve been impressed by both the FPS and the graphic quality. With the average game being around 4/5 gig, the 128gig hard drive is more than enough for 20+ games. The only negatives are the build quality of the stock head strap and the very overpriced overpriced official “elite” replacement which is poorly reviewed for breaking easily. The battery life is also around 3 hours, you probably shouldn’t be playing for 3 hours straight anyway, so that hasn’t been an issue.",2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Stacks, 35 - 44, Cardiff"
219,Best toy i've bought in a long time,"Im still blown away by the oculus and so are all my friends who have a go. You will not regret buying one of these. No PC required, great graphics and truly immersive game play.",2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael, 35 - 44, Clitheroe"

222,Great all in one headset.,"You can play this headset straight out of the box. You need to set up a facebook account but then you can play games without needing a pc or any other equipment.

223,Great for Excercise,"Bought this a month ago - and have mainly been using it for the excercise apps, its motivating and the weight is dropping after 3 weeks - i can see myself keeping up my excercise routine because its just so immersive, unlike the gym, which i usualy given up on after a short while. This keep me wanting to do more.",2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Baggysport, 45 - 54, East Sussex"
224,My son loves it,I bought this for my 13 year old son for his birthday as it was the only thing he wanted. He absolutely loves it and was so happy with it. I think its a bit costly for what it is and could possibly be better if you could connect it to consoles to play games on there. But it was worth the money just to see the look on his face when he opened it,2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Ashton, 25 - 34, Isle of Wight"

233,it is not possible to return with argos,"I had a bad experience with oculus quest, my head was spinning. but argos does not accept returns for this because I used it for 5 min!!! I had to resell it privately and lost money, so be careful",2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"lalla, 35 - 44, brighton"
234,Very disappointing and restrictive,"I would buy this again and sent straight back. It does not work well tethered to a pc which isn't surprising when I think the rift S has display port and the quest has usb C. It runs poorly for pcvr games in comparison to the rift S and over airlink the graphics are compressed then decompressed for the WiFi stream, lowering the quality. They upper the Hz to 120 for this device but pointless unless you pay a game installed as stand-alone on the headset itself. Additionally you have to have a Facebook account and you must be logged into it in our to use the device. No internet means no quest and renders it a very expensive paper weight. Pointless device and a waste of money. Go for a rift S or Give if you can afford.",2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"abstractrobbie, 45 - 54, Huddersfield"
235,Great VR experience,"Have waited a long time for this and I'm glad I finally got it. There's a great, but small, range of games, fitness, and lots of free entertainment (and paid for - eg films or concerts). Beat Saber, for example, is even better without having to worry about pulling out or stepping on the cable (I have a PSVR). Check out some of the FB groups and get a referral code for store credit - enough for Beat Saber to be free right now. It's also great to be able to play in different places (I've read about people using it while travelling or in their hotel) - I've also watched some YouTube VR and tried the Space Station experience while lying in bed. I recommend trying Bigscreen - you can watch things in your own virtual cinema (you can choose different types of location and your spot in front of the screen) by yourself, or with friends. You can also attend shows and concerts if you pay extra. Fitness is one of the main reasons I got this - boxing games, sport and gym games, music games .. and the distraction of the game really helps keep you going. However, there are some negatives - the headset isn't comfortable straight out of the box. You really need to get a different strap or attachment- check out reviews on YouTube to help you decide. There are better foam attachments for the part that touches your face, and grips for the controllers because the surface is too smooth. It's annoying that you can need so many extras, but you should get them, it's worth the extra money. Also, you can easily use it without a PC, but this also means you're missing out on a much bigger range of games and better graphics - eg the latest Half Life game. Overall, it's a great introduction to VR, in many ways it's much better than the PSVR and there are some amazing experiences waiting for you. But make sure you check out some of the YT reviews to help you get the most out of it.",2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Rich, 45 - 54, England"
236,Great features.,I bought this product about a month ago and am very pleased with what I bought here. Because the price is right and the service is very good.,2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"BarslLVl, 18 - 24, Wellingborough"

238,Amazing!! Nothing else compares.,"I have had VR head sets prior to the Oculus quest 2, all have been a pain to setup, get right and always blurry. The Oculus is comfortable and easy to wear unlike all other headsets I had used. This even as a single unit is brilliant, no PC or PlayStation required but connecting it to the PC was something else. easy to link to the PC and Steam VR with quality game play. A must have for the VR world",2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Muffin, 35 - 44, West Midlands"
239,Mind blowing VR,Been so happy with this since I got it. If anything I should have bought the larger capacity hard drive version. Wireless airlink to my laptop works flawlessly for steamVR games.,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"QuestingInVr, 25 - 34, Norwich, Uk"
240,No regrets buying this,Bought for the kids but I'm using it more than them. Really interesting to see how immersive this is. Not much free content but most games aren't too expensive. Very happy with the purchase.,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"tonys312, 45 - 54, Nottingham"

243,Hours of fun,I have had this 3 weeks you need a Facebook account to play but no need for a console or pc. You can buy games or play the many free to play games so far I have brought one game because I enjoy the many free games on offer. I gave it 4 stars because it is a great VR headset but the strap let’s it down but I just brought a better head strap now I am fully happy with it. I also got a nice stand for my headset to keep it safe.,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"AdamP, 35 - 44, Cambridgeshire"
244,Oculus Quest 2,"Design: The headset looks sleek and well designed. I would recommend fitting the provided glasses spacer and silicone cover before even using the headset, which improves comfort considerably. If you are not used to wearing a headset, the weight on your head can feel uncomfortable initially, but it is not a deal-breaker as this is something that you get used to over time. One thing to note, there are only 3 lens settings for IPD (distance between eyes). However, these 3 options should accommodate most people. Battery life: Roughly 2.5 hours from a full charge, which, if you think about it, is pretty good considering it is a standalone product and is not wired to anything. However, it does charge quickly with the provided charger, which is good. If you want to use it for extended periods, make sure you have a long USB-C cable and plug it into the mains as the one provided is very short (keep in mind, the headset may get warm during extended use.) Connectivity: Simple as can be, turn the headset on and away you go. I recommend Oculus Link (or Air Link, which is even better if you have the internet speed for it!) if you have a gaming PC alongside the headset. Oculus/Air Link will enable you to play SteamVR titles such as Half-Life: Alyx etc., which wouldn't be otherwise available on the Quest 2. Ease of use: Impossibly easy setup and general use, but you require a FaceBook account, which isn't ideal. Also, you will need money aside to buy games/applications, so keep that in mind - there are some free applications, but for fully-fledged experiences, you'll most likely need some extra money. In conclusion, I would recommend the Quest 2 to people looking for an introduction to VR and people who have experienced VR in the past. For the price, nothing in the market can currently beat it.",2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Oli B, 18 - 24, Gloucestershire"

251,Brilliant camera and wire free device,We had an older VR but struggled with it being linked to a PC and getting the cameras positioned correctly. I couldn’t believe how reasonable the price of this was. It is fantastic and very accurate and you can move it all over the house. Creating a FB account was easy and I don’t use it other than for this. My partner loves tennis and it gives him a workout and I get mine from the brilliant Beat Saber.

269,"Not as good as the Quest 1, but still excellent.","I was surprised by how much smaller this headset is compared to my Quest 1, but on the plus side it's lighter and more comfortable (once I added the improved strap which Argos also sell). The screen is less impressive, not being OLED, which means blacks are now grey, and the eyepiece positioning adjustment is clunky with a poor field-of-view. The resolution is fantastic though – no screen-door at all, and running it as a VR headset for my gaming PC gives excellent performance, for much less than a dedicated PC VR headset.",2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"DaveMania, 45 - 54, Glasgow"

278,2022 Virtual Reality that works,"Almost 40 years old I needed to decide on something for my birthday and I chose this, after playing with the PlayStation VR a few years ago but constrained by the wire and using a PS4 the fact the Quest 2 is standalone is awesome. The setup is dead simple however you need a Facebook account at the moment but who doesn't have one these days. The game selection is great with very demanding titles and experiences all reasonably priced, and a lot of free ones too. Also used to view movies from popular streaming services on a massive screen floating in front of your face. Only drawback is the battery life it struggles to last a couple of hours on demanding stuff and the it takes a while to charge up. Can be used also with a PC which I do, but with a laptop has some issues because of the way laptop graphics work I ended up getting software from the store to make it work as airplay or link didn't work.",2022-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"McSherlock, 35 - 44, Surrey, UK"

298,Brilliant bit of kit,"I had the ps version when it first came out, didnt enjoy it that much, wires everywhere and could only look at the screen as when you look away you just see black. The oculus has cameras built in which means, no wires and 360 degrees of virtual reality. Games, yes you do have to but them but they are cheap going from around £5 - the newest games at around £26.

It's a great experience that generally just works, as opposed to some other systems, and is easy enough to set up and get going. You don't need a PC, and there aren't any cables (apart from when you're charging it of course). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you need a Facebook/Meta account to use it.",2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,"emzo, 45 - 54, North Wales"

317,Amazing,"The Oculus Quest 2 is my first VR headset and experience. It feels like you are stepping into another reality. The experience is like nothing I have ever had before. If you want to get into VR, this is the best standalone headset (No PC) required for loads of games. If you want better graphics and access to more games you will need a PC that is VR ready and link cable.

328,"Comfortable, convenient and safe","I was wary at first because tech reviews on YouTube said the basic strap is uncomfortable but honestly I find it absolutely fine. If you're someone who isn't always home and has children then it's well worth it as it's easy to carry around, though I do recommend getting silicone covers for the controllers and especially protection for the lenses, as the cost of fixing the lenses is so high you may as well buy a whole new headset. The best thing about the Oculus is the safety features, you create the boundaries around your living room and it will warn you if you're stepping outside of them. Once you step outside them you can see everything around you. It can break immersion in games at times but it's a still a feature best to have. It does have 2 hour battery life which can be extended by getting an external battery, but especially for children I think 2 hours is enough. I have been told its best not to plug it into the mains to play it as it can potentially damage it.",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Kw93, 25 - 34, West Cheshire"
329,Fantastic bit of kit,"I have had this a couple of weeks now and bought it to replace a PSVR unit. I have used this device more in 2 weeks that I did the psvr is 3 years. The lack of cables, improved controllers and hand tracking capabilities just bring games and experiences to life. My only criticism is that the default strap is not as comfortable as it could be. After an hour I found the device was feeling quite uncomfortable on my head. There are plenty of products out there to resolve this issue, but does require a little more investment. Leaving at 5 stars as I still think it's value for money and great unit.",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Kompo, 35 - 44, Fleet, hampshire"

332,"Great headset, shame about the strap","I've had this headset for a few weeks now, it was easy to set up - brand new condition - and much more lightweight in comparison to the Quest 1. (If using a Link cable) it also holds charge for a good few hours. Getting set up to play via the PC was a bit of a hasstle but once it has been it's now a very straightforward process. When in-game, the Oculus app is okay to use, not the best but it's easy to figure out. Sometimes the loading screens between games/steam/virtual desktop can lag/jitter, this is something to get use to. The main downside to this product is the strap quality. It's awful and very uncomfortable. I had to buy an alternative strap to make this wearable. For the price, I would have expected a much better quality strap to come with the product. The face visors are also not the best. The sponge one causes skin burn and soaks up sweat making it very unhygienic. The silicon one although easier to clean is very hard and does cause some strain. Again, I would reccomend buying a soft padded face visor for this item. I've done this and it makes wearing time much more pleasent! If purchasing for a young person/child, due to weight and comfort I highly recommend buying a better (weighted) head strap and face visor. Overall, it's a very good product, much better than the Quest 1, great charging hold, and lost of great games to enjoy!",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"laurie, 25 - 34, Bristol"

337,Great VR entry,Bought the headset a few weeks ago and have been enjoying playing Oculus exclusives but also linking to my pc. Oculus' air link ability is by far the best feature. Being able to connect to my gaming PC and stream the video to my headset whilst being in a different room is amazing. Removes tripping over wires and also allows you to go to a bigger room to play. Oculus' pass through video is handy for looking at your surroundings without having to take the headset off.

My wife is t a gamer at all but the oculus has changed her and she’s more obsessed with me. This is also helping us lose weight which is a major plus because you’re having fun at the same time!

367,Not sure its 100% new,"Item arrived when then they stated it would but I noticed when I went to set it up it had stickers on saying opened for inspection, the device already had an account (local) setup on it. that being said the stickers did say it had been inspected so maybe the account that was on it was there just to check it. That being said the headset works and so far no issues. battery life leaves something to be desired but with a fast charge battery bank in my back pocket and a cable (usb c to usb c) running to the headset I'm getting 5 or so hours play time. The quest 2 is perfect for a starter headset and with a decent wireless router in house using airlink makes it completely wireless (unless your using a battery bank for extended game play), I would highly recommend buying the virtual desktop from the oculus market place instead of using Steam VR as Steam VR can be temperamental and very buggy.",2022-03-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Robert, 25 - 34, Cumbria, UK"

395,Bought mostly to play VR Steam games.,"Got this a while back to play VR Steam games (costed me an extra £15 for the software). Since its not designed for that it was a bit hard to set up due to the few extra stept you need to take on the device, on your phone AND on your PC. If used as intended as a standalone device its extremely easy to set up and use. Device works great, battery life is roughly 2.5-3 hours which is not bad but the device has one dealbraking issue. The strap is unbearably unconfortable for more than 15 minutes at a time since it ""holds it in place"" by pushing the device on your face. No matter how tight i make it it still slides and moves, and for that reason I had to buy a new strap and it lools like it was designed for people to buy the elite version. Opted for one that was not made by oculus since the Elite strap still pushes the device on your face even tho its more secure. Other than that, 100% would recommend. Also amazing for watching netflix on a big screen in a virtual cinema!",2022-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Johnny, 25 - 34, Scotland"

398,Hmmmmmm,"I must say as an adult I was just as excited to get this as my 14yr old son, after two weeks I’m now bored of it. Unless you are connecting to a gaming PC the graphics and game selection is poor. Battery life is around one hour.",2022-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy, 35 - 44, Wigan"

408,Great fun entering the metaverse!,"Fantastic Oculus quest 2. The video viewing experience is great but I spend most of my time gaming - which helps me be active!

410,Brilliant quality head VR head set,Quality head set but would recommend the Quest 2 elite head strap for longer playing times. Argos was the only store that actually had the head set in and I was fed up others saying they was getting them in but advertised on their site they were in? Perhaps it might have been the voucher I had for the store at the time but couldn’t because of transit issues ??

448,You NEED one of these!!!,"I have always been a gamer, but like most as I got older I had less time for it and felt guilty for any unhealthy time wasted in front of a screen. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER! With the quest you get to enjoy escapism in games, while on your feet and maybe even getting a little excercise! The standalone nature of the quest means setting up is a breeze, and getting into a game now takes moments. The games are so creative and a lot of them are online and highly social. The non game experiences are phenomenal too. From exploring the International Space Station, took goin on an adventure with Blue the raptor from Jurassic World. To sitting in a cinema watching films in 3D on a huge screen. All from the safety of your home! Honestly this product gives you souch for your money, totally recommended.",2022-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Real_ASP_Sy, 35 - 44, Somerset"
449,Great kit for all VR needs,"I brought this on the recommendation of my son. Moving from the PSVR I wasn’t expecting too much. I stand corrected the features and games that they have on the quest is countless hours of fun and can even help you with your organisation. You can wether wirelessly or wired connect this to a VR ready computer and play the entire steam library and more through this headset. If your looking for an affordable route to join the VR universe than this is for you. Also finger tracking, did I mention you don’t even need the controllers. Lastly the battery, it lasts a good 2/3 hours in the headset and a couple of weeks in the handsets. Battery’s are included in controllers.",2022-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"GhostUk, 35 - 44, eastleigh"

454,A great VR headset,"Its user friendly, works well as a stand alone or on PC using Oculus Link and Steam VR Software. Remotes are easy to use and maintain grip while pressing the buttons and triggers.

457,"Great features, terrible battery","I pondered for weeks whether to buy this. I researched the battery life etc and found it should last around 6-8hours, however in reality its died after 2-3 most. The headset is also heavy and uncomfortable-causing headaches from time to time.

484,Amazing how far VR has come,"I bought this expecting a basic VR experience. The VR itself and the games are so much more immersive than I thought they would be. There are tonnes of options for everyone in the game store and app lab. The battery time isn't the best (about 1 hour) but it does charge very quickly and you can buy straps with battery extenders built in. The guardian wall really makes this oculus stand out about anything else, it gives you a safe space in your home that you can move around in.

489,Immersive,"Bought this after playing on a friends. The main selling point for me was that it’s a self contained system, no need for a console of pc. You just need an internet connection. There’s a huge range of games available online and other immersive experiences. Battery life is around 3 to 4 hours depending on what your doing.

490,VR - it's the future!,"I love this VR headset, the games are really fun and engaging. The Quest 2 is at a great price point. Can't recommend enough! Wish they do it in black to make it more dirt and dust proof and connecting to a PC could be better. Don't like having to use a cable for that. However it still looks sleek and the option of running Steam VR is very cool.",2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy, 25 - 34, Cambridge"

498,Just a load of fun really,"I finally got one and I gotta say this thing is just fun especially with other people, the only downsides I would say are the fact that the additional things for the headset such as the cable for oculus link and the other attachments are expensive but you can find alternatives with a bit of looking",2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,"K, 18 - 24, Bolton"
499,"Oculus itself is great, but connecting to PC…","Oculus headset is great, the app store it comes with has some good games.

506,Honest review,"-The headstrap is fine, it doesnt feel too front heavy. -The battery life is fine, I get tired after one hour anyway -Any USB 3 rated for transfer can be used, don't buy the official one -Use a referral link to get store credit -The TOS is iffy but soon it should change as the Facebook account requirement is going to be removed",2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Jack101, 18 - 24"
507,"Portable, fun gaming gear","Bought this for some family fun and everybody uses it at home. Great picture and features. portability is a bonus without the need for a console.
