7,Awesome headset,"This is the first VR headset I have ever owned but both me and my partner are very impressed with it. So delighted that it also has a glasses spacer included. Overall I'm really impressed with it. Please be aware that if using with a PC you can only have 1 active monitor whilst using it otherwise the headset will have a glitchy connection and the visuals around you are distorted, laggy and it almost looks like you're surrounded by a warping void whilst wearing the headset. Turning off one of my 2 monitors hasn't worked so I'm yet to fix that by trying to completely disconnect the secondary monitor. The one con I have to mention is that it seems to be sliding forward quite a bit which can be disruptive to the game play and I'm considering purchasing the elite strap (potentially the one with a battery to balance the weight of it a bit).","Denisa, 25 - 34, Bristol",2022-12-13T00:00:00.000Z
8,So much fun,I bought this for my 13 year old nephews birthday and it was so easy to set up and start using. We set up the meta account in just a few mins and bought some games at the same time. The whole family tried it and it was so much fun and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this for anyone even a non gamer like me! The only problem is we had to keep charging it but that may be because we couldn’t wait until it was fully charged to start using it.,"Suesmillai, 45 - 54, Bookham",2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z
9,Another World,"This was an impulse buy after playing with one at our friends house, thought ‘will we use it? Well, we haven’t put it down since we brought it home. Oh what fun, absolutely love it!

11,Would not Set up,I returned ours. After setting up Facebook accounts and Meta accounts we had to pair phone to headset. It connected itself by bluetooth during the set up process but kept asking for a code after I put my credit card in. By then the code wasn't displayed but we remembered it. When we put it in it said already paired try again. We gave up. It says easy to set up on the box. Shame but bought a Pico4 instead which is much better,"Nottyash, 45 - 54, Scarborough",2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z

29,"Some amazing points, some not so good.","Overall, pleased. It has some great games, the new Iron Man VR, although predictable is enjoyable. Vader Immortal is also great. Headstraps are OK, but you can add better aftermarket straps. Battery life is only a couple of hours, however that's as much as I can take before motion sickness kicks in. Again, this can be supplemented by additional battery packs, or by wearing while plugged in. Has the ability to put down controllers and sense your hands, which is great to see, although not as functional as the handsets. Better than the old, stick a phone in a box trick. It has passthrough which is a grainy black and white, so not suitable for any form of hybrid viewing other than basic orientation. Does come with speakers positioned just by the ears which are adequate, although maybe irritating for others in the room.","Martin, 35 - 44, Birmingham, West midlands",2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z

39,Awesome!,"This is a cool little device. I bought it since my computer isn’t fully VR ready yet so it’s perfect! I would recommend, if you’re new to VR like me, to be aware you’ll need regular breaks since you will get dizzy and motion sickness. Also, start off sitting until you have gotten used to it. Overall great device!!","J, 35 - 44, Uk",2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z
40,What he wanted for Xmas,Bought for Xmas present for Grandson do not know anything about it,"Gran, 65 or over",2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z
41,Exceeded all my expectations,I bought this for cinema style entertainment but the full VR experiences and 360 degree vidoes are amazing and there is no much free content. As a standalone unit I think this is a really good entertainment system and far more immersive than I realised.,"jo, 45 - 54, East Anglia",2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z

46,Meta quest 2,"Recently bought this item, quality is amazing. However not as big of games range as u thought, a lot are videos! Definitely say the age range is 10+ maybe older as I bought this for my son and without wearing the headset we haven’t a clue how to help him. Although it’s fantastic graphics and overall a great gadget/gaming console I wish we waited a few years as not used like I thought he would and the head piece can be rather uncomfortable.","Chantelle, 25 - 34, South yorkshire",2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z

48,Game changer for my Autistic Son,"My son has wanted one for over a year, but the lack of a powerful graphics card in his PC, limited his options. We decided on this as it was a stand alone option, and he loves it. Can amerce himself out of the real world and regulate his emotions. Shame its so expensive!","JRAY, 45 - 54, Surrey",2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z
49,Incredible tech,I was apprehensive about buying this as I thought it might be something I use a couple of times then put down and never use again. I was wrong. I use it every day. It’s a completely different way to play games and socialise. Careful though - I have found certain games and experiences give me motion sickness and eye strain over prolonged use. Also the battery life is terrible so you will be charging it a lot. Don’t let those things put you off though as it really is an amazing bit of kit.,"Stumanji, 35 - 44, Stoke-on-Trent",2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z
50,Decent VR in a portable package!,"Having been interacting with VR since the launch of the original Oculus, I found this to be a wonderful way to introduce VR to people. Heading out away from home, a unit that is not tethered to a PC, while not as an amazing an experience, does more than well enough to demonstrate VR! Decent battery life, good tracking, its hard to go wrong.","Kerry, 25 - 34, Enfield",2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z

58,Amazing vr headset,I purchased this headset to mainly play vr games through my PC. It handles that task very well (though you will need to connect to your pc via a long cable) I'm really impressed with playing games through the headset itself without the need for a PC. Great battery life too for the amount of processing required for these games.,"Andrew P, 35 - 44, Rugby",2022-10-12T00:00:00.000Z

69,Best gaming experience in years,After seeing a buddies Valve Index and trying out other VR headsets I took a risk and ordered the Quest2 - what a great decision - being able to play native stand alone oculus games (some of which are stunning) without having to connect to a PC is worth the asking price on its own - connect wirelessly to the PC and the wow factor kicks in - DCS / Star Wars Squadrons / Elite Dangerous / Project Cars 3 / Dirt Rally 2 and RaceRoom are all awesome add to that access to play Half Life Alyx and other Steam VR games and this becomes the greatest thing since wide screen monitors - resolution is about the same as the index (FOV narrower) but it does not matter as this is great value and I will not hesitate to recommend it - buying/installing games on the quest is easy - connecting to a PC (needs to be able to run Steam VR well) again is easy and the sense of being there is awesome. The only gripe is the rubbish strap it comes with - invest in something like the BOVOVR PRO2 and its very comfortable for hours.,"Deckard64, 55 - 64, Woking, Surrey, UK",2022-09-28T00:00:00.000Z

78,Amazing entertainment device for games and movies,"Once I had downloaded some apps and a few games, I was able to quickly learn how to use the device to its potential. The instructions are not very helpful and you have to learn how to use many features through experimentation and looking at blogs for the Quest 2. The Warplanes flight games are amazing and so are movies on netflix and amazon prime (although the prime app crashes sometimes). It is cool that you can link apple headphones through bluetooth and Amazon sells a cheaper clone charging cable that lets ths headset charge whist you use it. I wish I had bought the 256 gb model :(","shark1691, 45 - 54, Herts",2022-09-25T00:00:00.000Z

84,Amazing technology..Mind blowing,I love this Quest 2 VR as the graphics are amazing. There is so much to do for all the family or just for yourself.

97,Versatile VR experience,"The Quest 2 is a well designed VR headset that has the versatility to work as standalone, or connected to a PC for a wider choice of games (if the pc is up to it!). The choice of games is good and growing all the time, just search the Oculus store and you can have a look before purchasing. Don't expect cutting edge visuals in standalone mode, its essentially mobile phone hardware powering the displays. But it gives the VR experience at around half the price of some of the other VR technologies, and without having to have a high spec gaming PC. Being standalone its great to travel with, just draw out the play area and you're good to go. It works really well as a ""party game"", cast the display to a TV and everyone can see whats on the headset getting everyone involved in the fun. I'd recommend an alternative strap such as the elite strap or similar for a more comfortable experience.","User, 25 - 34",2022-09-18T00:00:00.000Z
98,Epic gaming and media device,An epic gaming and media device even though it is getting old now. If you are into gaming this will take it to the next level and if not using your PC or watching Streaming services in a variety of big screen environments is just great.,"Smokay2k, 35 - 44",2022-09-15T00:00:00.000Z

102,Loved it,"I bought this a little while ago and have been trying it out ever since and i can say it was worth the money. You are spoilt for choice with games and apps, although most you have to pay for. Saying that there are a few free apps like vr chat and a few others to keep you going.","Reidwene, 45 - 54, Southend-on-Sea, Essex",2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z
103,Excellent experience,Very impressive VR experience. Never realised the technology was that good until experiencing for myself. The quest 2 is impressive and well made.,"Matt, 25 - 34, Ystalyfera",2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z
104,Great product!,Bought this just over one month ago and it's had so much use already. It's worth every penny and works great!,"Shell, 25 - 34, Hampshire",2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z
105,Play video games and get a workout,"Play video games and get a workout. This is excellent technology and a great way of experience video games in a different dimension. If you get used to the motion of the screen in front of you then you enjoy your moment in this technology and have a great experience. Pass you get the added benefit of getting a workout, Doing an hour on beat Saber really get you into a sweat and get your heart pumping. I love using mine and have used it almost every day since having it, even meeting up with friends in virtual rooms and chatting and it’s like them being right in front of you.","Devondice, 35 - 44, Plymouth",2022-09-02T00:00:00.000Z

107,A whole new world,"Wow! I'm absolutely delighted with this device. I bought it primarily for flight simulator to connect to my pc and although I really need to upgrade my pc to cope with it, I just can't go back to a flat screen now! If you don't want to use it with a pc it will work very nicely on it's own connected to WiFi and there are hundreds of games movies and apps available for it, including some fun free stuff. I would say that the standard strap is really uncomfortable but there are others available. I also bought the elite headstrap with battery which is a bit expensive but is much better than standard and doubles the time you can use it between charges.","NigelH, 55 - 64, Peacehaven",2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z
108,A brilliant vr experience,"Bought this to fill time in on my holidays and very happy i bought it. Some great titles avilable.. I like that theres no cable needed which is miles better than the earlier Rift. And while it can be attached to a PC for PCVR, its strength is in its own titles.. The only downer, the price went up £100.. But thats my choice to buy or not.","Davez, 55 - 64, Sunderland",2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z

110,Best VR Headset for Money,"I am very glad that I decided to buy the Quest 2, it has allowed me to play VR games at a far more affordable price and it has fantastic visual quality for a wireless headset.

116,Amazing Experience,"I'm 68 and this my first VR experience. Wow I absolutely love it. I play Synth Riders each day which is so much fun it doesn't feel like exercise. With Wander I got back to Munich walking along the streets. Brink is great to see mountains, canyons and other landscapes where I feel giddy when I think I'm about to fall of a mountain lol. I can't believe how real it all feels as though you are actually in that place. There are so many more things to experience with the Quest but I haven't got around to trying them all out yet. All in all I'm so glad I purchased this and expect to have many more hours of enjoyment with it.","Trish, 65 or over, Dunfermline",2022-08-16T00:00:00.000Z

118,Amazing little piece of technology,"I bought this about a month ago and, I'm really not a gamer, but I needed to start doing some exercise which I hate. With Meta Quest 2 I'm having fun and exercising (Beat Saber is my favourite). There are a lot of other features that make this a great purchase.","Maria, 45 - 54, Birmingham",2022-08-16T00:00:00.000Z

121,Amazing VR set,I bought this as a gift for my son and it was hard to get my head around the fact this is a stand alone product so no console is needed to play it but it works straight out of the box and you need to download an app onto your phone to use it but you can stream the video so you can watch as someone plays. You do need a Facebook account to get started but I linked this to my own account as my 12yr old doesn't have Facebook.,"NottsL, 35 - 44, Hucknall",2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z
122,Oculus,Pleased I could pick up straight away. Enjoy playing this and bought a few games. Like that my lorry driving game can link onto this.,"Chris, 45 - 54, County Durham",2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z

124,Really Fun,It is so much fun and lots of stuff to do,"TjtheDj, 35 - 44",2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z
125,Best VR currently available,"I'm blown away by VR as watching videos on people using it on screen cannot possibly compare. After doing a lot of research this is the best overall VR currently available. My two gripes are that the battery life is relatively short between charges and the USB port to connect to a pc is placed in a weird place where you end up knocking it out while playing. Minor issues, though considering the positives.","JB, 35 - 44, Crawley",2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z
126,Absolutely amazing! So much fun!,"I bought this for my sons 10th birthday and it is used every day by kids and adults. There are some amazing games to play, some free and some that you can purchase. It keeps us entertained for hours so I'd thoroughly recommend this for any age! The only down side I'd say is the battery life for the headset, but that's to be expected with how much use it has.","st90, 25 - 34, Leeds",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z

128,Educational and fun!,"My boys saved up for a year to buy this and we’re not disappointed. They love scaring everyone with the plank walking experience. I love that they can visit places around the world. There are lots of free games but no filter to just see the free ones so worth looking for free game on another device first. New paid games we’ve got have been between £10-£20 which is much cheaper than Xbox or PS games. I love that it gets them up and actively playing rather than sitting still. It also comes with a spacer for those who wear glasses so you don’t have to remove them which was a great thoughtful touch. Finally, a piece of tech we can all agree is great!","Sarah4Palace, 35 - 44, Surrey",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z
129,Awesome,This is an amazing piece of equipment it gives you the option to make a grid and if you step out of the grid your screen will come off so you can see where you are in the room. Highly recommend if you want the virtual experience.,"Bretskii93, 25 - 34, Peterborough",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z
130,Brilliant!,I bought this a month ago for my son's 11th birthday. He is over the moon with it. It's a brilliant piece of kit! The graphics are brilliant and definitely worth the money,"Emylou, 35 - 44, North Walsham",2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z

132,Great piece of kit,"Bought this for my son's birthday, bit pricey, but he loves it. Different games available to play/download. I tried it, but suffer from motion sickness, so nope - but everything seemed really good and well laid out to follow.

133,Great toy but battery not last long,+ Great graphics Reality of movement Good fun - Battery life,"Arek, 35 - 44, Bradford",2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z
134,It's pretty mid,"For every good thing there is a bad thing; you can bring it anywhere but it only has a two hour battery life, it's more affordable than other products but you might find yourself buying lots of attachments to it, it's easy to pack up, but the strap is super uncomfortable. Overall I would recommend this product only if you have more then enough chedda' because it's pretty much only bearable with if you buy more with it. Oh and for the love of God... DON'T BUY THE ELITE STRAP, THEY ALL BREAK WITHIN A YEAR!!!","Your future husband, 18 - 24",2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z

138,Great fun!,"Thought this would be a way that the whole family could have fun, and I wasn’t wrong. It’s a strange feeling when you first put the headset on but fascinating. It’s been hilarious watching others on it. Would advise getting an elite head strap. Absolutely recommend.","Misha, 45 - 54, Worcestershire",2022-07-26T00:00:00.000Z

144,Very robust,"I wanted to test everything out before writing a review. To begin with, the quest 2 is an amazing device with superb graphics though not as clear as watching on a screen but it is surprisingly clear. I have try some movies and YouTube and was so cool.

164,Best Bang for Your Buck!,"If you are looking to get into the world of VR, this is a great place to start. The setup is spectacularly easy, setup your Wifi and log in with your Facebook account setup a safety zone in the headset which shows you when you are leaving you're chosen safe area and you're good to go. With the ability to connect to a PC/Laptop either through a link cable (£20 ish) or using air link via the Wifi you can play a multitude of games using for example steamVR, But there is plenty of content without the need to even own a PC/Laptop. If you wear glasses, not an issue the Quest 2 comes with a spacer to help but, I have found I don't need this and my glasses don't touch the lenses in the headset (which could scratch the lenses in the headset). The headset is fairly comfortable to wear however you do need to fiddle to get the lenses in the ""sweet spot"" otherwise you get a blurry view, however once you figure it out it is easy to get the correct position within a few seconds of putting it on. There are apps for experiencining 3D movies, full 360 degree events like a music concerts, educational films, museums, historic sites, an ISS tour or even a space walk and genuinely tons more. Google Earth VR is fantastic. All in all I love the quest 2 and have no hesitation in recommending it to others looking to get into VR, at this price point it truly is great value for money, And at no point have I been dissapointed.","MH, 35 - 44, East Anglia",2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z

167,THE FUTURE,"Very impressed, the technology seems very early, the headset is way ahead of its time but it’s fantastic quality, very well built and the games are very very good, once you have used it for a while you forget about where you actually are in reality and only see the VR world, my son who it was bought for absolutely loves it","Danny, 35 - 44, Sheffield",2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z

170,Honestly? Go for it!,"I have purchased this product about a month ago after reading so many reviews and product comparisons between the quest and rift and htc vive i felt more confused than ever. I decided to just go for the quest 2 as it wqs cheaper than the vive and could do just as much as the rift if i bought thr cable for it. The cabke cost about £89 however, after a little digging around i discovered the airlink feature and developer mode. Now the airlink isnt perfect, sometimes it lags , doesnt connect or is just slow, but after a restart and or reconnect? Believe me when i say this is the most versatile and capabke vr headset on the market, coming in at an amazing and affordable price as well as tools like sidequest to play experminetal games i can safelet say this is the perfect no nonsense vr headset for begginer or addicted vr users. Amazing product 11/5","Squob, 18 - 24, Burton upon trent",2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z

182,Great vr headset for the money !,"I purchased the quest 2 primarily for sim racing on pc, I got a link cable and it does exactly what I wanted it to do. The image quality is very good for the price, I am really enjoying racing in vr, I have also purchased some games from the oculus store and have been using the headset to play them also, there are some good games on the store. The stock strap isn’t great and neither is the facial interface but I got an AMVR head back padding that completely transformed the stock strap, and I also got AMVR resilient facial interface which is way more comfortable than the stock interface. Those items were definitely worth the investment, you might be lucky and find it comfortable as is, but I would expect to have to buy some extras to make it comfortable. Now I suppose I should mention the fact that you need a Facebook account to use it, I really don’t like Facebook and really wasn’t happy about the fact you must have an account to use the quest 2, but I have setup an account and locked it down so nobody can find me so it doesn’t really matter that much. All in all I am very pleased with the Quest 2, it does exactly what I want it to do and more, I have spent several hours playing it and expect to spend several more. For the price I don’t think you can beat it, I would recommend it to anybody who want’s to get into vr.","Mark, 45 - 54, Suffolk, UK",2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z

185,Funky!,My son loves this and plays online with friends who also have one. There aren't many games on this at the moment but its definitely the future.

192,Great VR,"Amazing VR although be prepared - everything needs to be paid for, so don’t expect to just pick up and play. You will need to pay for all games and apps - there’s maybe 2-3 free ones and a few demo’s. Still though great tech, very seamless in its functionality. Be prepared to charge it regularly. Great for teens.","Mummybear, 25 - 34, Surrey",2022-06-10T00:00:00.000Z
193,Good Quality!,"I bought this a few weeks ago and boy is it amazing! The packaging came perfectly, unopened and protected.

It was fully factory reseted and brand new from official Meta!!","TechnoFrog, 45 - 54, Retford, Nottinghamshire",2022-06-08T00:00:00.000Z
194,Brilliant!!!,"Had the Oculus Quest 2 about 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.

207,Changed my life!,"Easy to use, comfortable to wear. I'm in my 50s, a big girl with a fat face and wear glasses. I have been using it to do dancing, exercising and tai chi and it's been fantastic. Suggest you invest in a sweat guard or a wipeable face insert if you're going to be doing anything sweaty! Also suggest if you're new to VR to buy some ginger biscuits and ginger beer to help with the initial queasiness. Go slow at first until you acclimatise. Battery is about 2-3 hours, easily plugged in. I also play games with my partner, eg Rec Room paintball. Great VR experience.","andwhowantstoknow, 45 - 54, Dunfermline",2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z
208,Exceeded expectations,"Really happy with my Quest 2, mine was still Oculus branded rather than Meta. Surprised that I could still wear my glasses while using the Quest. Make sure to add the glasses spacer though. The unit comes with a silicone protector for the foam section that sits against the face, making it more comfortable. You still get an imprint if you wear the headset for long enough. Don't plan on going out anywhere for a bit after a decent gaming session ;) Set up was easy and make sure to do the referral thing if a friend already has a Quest 2. You get some money credit for buying some apps/games. Battery life is reasonable, but if you get a 15m USB cable (for linking to a PC) you can keep yourself charged up while playing. But I'll eventually get the integrated battery pack head strap. Make sure to visit the Oculus website, plus download the Oculus app onto your mobile. The mobile app will make it easy to set up your Quest 2. Although there are instructions in the box on how to do this. Yeah, overall I'm happy with my purchase.","andrew_f, 35 - 44, Castle Cary, Somerset",2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z

222,Surprisingly Powerful,"Coming from an Oculus Rift I was concerned that there might be a huge drop off in quality as the quest is a standalone device, but I’ve been impressed by both the FPS and the graphic quality. With the average game being around 4/5 gig, the 128gig hard drive is more than enough for 20+ games. The only negatives are the build quality of the stock head strap and the very overpriced overpriced official “elite” replacement which is poorly reviewed for breaking easily. The battery life is also around 3 hours, you probably shouldn’t be playing for 3 hours straight anyway, so that hasn’t been an issue.","Stacks, 35 - 44, Cardiff",2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z

226,Great all in one headset.,"You can play this headset straight out of the box. You need to set up a facebook account but then you can play games without needing a pc or any other equipment.

227,Great for Excercise,"Bought this a month ago - and have mainly been using it for the excercise apps, its motivating and the weight is dropping after 3 weeks - i can see myself keeping up my excercise routine because its just so immersive, unlike the gym, which i usualy given up on after a short while. This keep me wanting to do more.","Baggysport, 45 - 54, East Sussex",2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z
228,My son loves it,I bought this for my 13 year old son for his birthday as it was the only thing he wanted. He absolutely loves it and was so happy with it. I think its a bit costly for what it is and could possibly be better if you could connect it to consoles to play games on there. But it was worth the money just to see the look on his face when he opened it,"Ashton, 25 - 34, Isle of Wight",2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z

237,it is not possible to return with argos,"I had a bad experience with oculus quest, my head was spinning. but argos does not accept returns for this because I used it for 5 min!!! I had to resell it privately and lost money, so be careful","lalla, 35 - 44, brighton",2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z
238,Very disappointing and restrictive,"I would buy this again and sent straight back. It does not work well tethered to a pc which isn't surprising when I think the rift S has display port and the quest has usb C. It runs poorly for pcvr games in comparison to the rift S and over airlink the graphics are compressed then decompressed for the WiFi stream, lowering the quality. They upper the Hz to 120 for this device but pointless unless you pay a game installed as stand-alone on the headset itself. Additionally you have to have a Facebook account and you must be logged into it in our to use the device. No internet means no quest and renders it a very expensive paper weight. Pointless device and a waste of money. Go for a rift S or Give if you can afford.","abstractrobbie, 45 - 54, Huddersfield",2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z
239,Great VR experience,"Have waited a long time for this and I'm glad I finally got it. There's a great, but small, range of games, fitness, and lots of free entertainment (and paid for - eg films or concerts). Beat Saber, for example, is even better without having to worry about pulling out or stepping on the cable (I have a PSVR). Check out some of the FB groups and get a referral code for store credit - enough for Beat Saber to be free right now. It's also great to be able to play in different places (I've read about people using it while travelling or in their hotel) - I've also watched some YouTube VR and tried the Space Station experience while lying in bed. I recommend trying Bigscreen - you can watch things in your own virtual cinema (you can choose different types of location and your spot in front of the screen) by yourself, or with friends. You can also attend shows and concerts if you pay extra. Fitness is one of the main reasons I got this - boxing games, sport and gym games, music games .. and the distraction of the game really helps keep you going. However, there are some negatives - the headset isn't comfortable straight out of the box. You really need to get a different strap or attachment- check out reviews on YouTube to help you decide. There are better foam attachments for the part that touches your face, and grips for the controllers because the surface is too smooth. It's annoying that you can need so many extras, but you should get them, it's worth the extra money. Also, you can easily use it without a PC, but this also means you're missing out on a much bigger range of games and better graphics - eg the latest Half Life game. Overall, it's a great introduction to VR, in many ways it's much better than the PSVR and there are some amazing experiences waiting for you. But make sure you check out some of the YT reviews to help you get the most out of it.","Rich, 45 - 54, England",2022-05-10T00:00:00.000Z

247,Hours of fun,I have had this 3 weeks you need a Facebook account to play but no need for a console or pc. You can buy games or play the many free to play games so far I have brought one game because I enjoy the many free games on offer. I gave it 4 stars because it is a great VR headset but the strap let’s it down but I just brought a better head strap now I am fully happy with it. I also got a nice stand for my headset to keep it safe.,"AdamP, 35 - 44, Cambridgeshire",2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z
248,Oculus Quest 2,"Design: The headset looks sleek and well designed. I would recommend fitting the provided glasses spacer and silicone cover before even using the headset, which improves comfort considerably. If you are not used to wearing a headset, the weight on your head can feel uncomfortable initially, but it is not a deal-breaker as this is something that you get used to over time. One thing to note, there are only 3 lens settings for IPD (distance between eyes). However, these 3 options should accommodate most people. Battery life: Roughly 2.5 hours from a full charge, which, if you think about it, is pretty good considering it is a standalone product and is not wired to anything. However, it does charge quickly with the provided charger, which is good. If you want to use it for extended periods, make sure you have a long USB-C cable and plug it into the mains as the one provided is very short (keep in mind, the headset may get warm during extended use.) Connectivity: Simple as can be, turn the headset on and away you go. I recommend Oculus Link (or Air Link, which is even better if you have the internet speed for it!) if you have a gaming PC alongside the headset. Oculus/Air Link will enable you to play SteamVR titles such as Half-Life: Alyx etc., which wouldn't be otherwise available on the Quest 2. Ease of use: Impossibly easy setup and general use, but you require a FaceBook account, which isn't ideal. Also, you will need money aside to buy games/applications, so keep that in mind - there are some free applications, but for fully-fledged experiences, you'll most likely need some extra money. In conclusion, I would recommend the Quest 2 to people looking for an introduction to VR and people who have experienced VR in the past. For the price, nothing in the market can currently beat it.","Oli B, 18 - 24, Gloucestershire",2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z

Very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended, also my son said best gift ever.","Rosie29, 45 - 54, London",2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z
273,"Not as good as the Quest 1, but still excellent.","I was surprised by how much smaller this headset is compared to my Quest 1, but on the plus side it's lighter and more comfortable (once I added the improved strap which Argos also sell). The screen is less impressive, not being OLED, which means blacks are now grey, and the eyepiece positioning adjustment is clunky with a poor field-of-view. The resolution is fantastic though – no screen-door at all, and running it as a VR headset for my gaming PC gives excellent performance, for much less than a dedicated PC VR headset.","DaveMania, 45 - 54, Glasgow",2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z

282,2022 Virtual Reality that works,"Almost 40 years old I needed to decide on something for my birthday and I chose this, after playing with the PlayStation VR a few years ago but constrained by the wire and using a PS4 the fact the Quest 2 is standalone is awesome. The setup is dead simple however you need a Facebook account at the moment but who doesn't have one these days. The game selection is great with very demanding titles and experiences all reasonably priced, and a lot of free ones too. Also used to view movies from popular streaming services on a massive screen floating in front of your face. Only drawback is the battery life it struggles to last a couple of hours on demanding stuff and the it takes a while to charge up. Can be used also with a PC which I do, but with a laptop has some issues because of the way laptop graphics work I ended up getting software from the store to make it work as airplay or link didn't work.","McSherlock, 35 - 44, Surrey, UK",2022-04-12T00:00:00.000Z

The oculus has cameras built in which means, no wires and 360 degrees of virtual reality. Games, yes you do have to but them but they are cheap going from around £5 - the newest games at around £26.

317,Best VR system currently available,"I use and develop software/content for VR systems at work, and I must say, the Oculus Quest 2 is a very polished product. It's a great experience that generally just works, as opposed to some other systems, and is easy enough to set up and get going. You don't need a PC, and there aren't any cables (apart from when you're charging it of course). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you need a Facebook/Meta account to use it.","emzo, 45 - 54, North Wales",2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z

321,Amazing,"The Oculus Quest 2 is my first VR headset and experience. It feels like you are stepping into another reality. The experience is like nothing I have ever had before. If you want to get into VR, this is the best standalone headset (No PC) required for loads of games. If you want better graphics and access to more games you will need a PC that is VR ready and link cable. The elite strap with battery is necessary for better comfort and extended play time.","Gem_Squash, 35 - 44, West Midlands",2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z

332,"Comfortable, convenient and safe","I was wary at first because tech reviews on YouTube said the basic strap is uncomfortable but honestly I find it absolutely fine. If you're someone who isn't always home and has children then it's well worth it as it's easy to carry around, though I do recommend getting silicone covers for the controllers and especially protection for the lenses, as the cost of fixing the lenses is so high you may as well buy a whole new headset. The best thing about the Oculus is the safety features, you create the boundaries around your living room and it will warn you if you're stepping outside of them. Once you step outside them you can see everything around you. It can break immersion in games at times but it's a still a feature best to have. It does have 2 hour battery life which can be extended by getting an external battery, but especially for children I think 2 hours is enough. I have been told its best not to plug it into the mains to play it as it can potentially damage it.","Kw93, 25 - 34, West Cheshire",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z
333,Fantastic bit of kit,"I have had this a couple of weeks now and bought it to replace a PSVR unit. I have used this device more in 2 weeks that I did the psvr is 3 years. The lack of cables, improved controllers and hand tracking capabilities just bring games and experiences to life. My only criticism is that the default strap is not as comfortable as it could be. After an hour I found the device was feeling quite uncomfortable on my head. There are plenty of products out there to resolve this issue, but does require a little more investment. Leaving at 5 stars as I still think it's value for money and great unit.","Kompo, 35 - 44, Fleet, hampshire",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z
334,All round good device,Bought for my grandson and he loves it,"Nanna, 65 or over, Yorkshire",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z
335,Great,Brought this as a birthday presentfor my son,"Peteh, 45 - 54, Derby",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z
336,"Great headset, shame about the strap","I've had this headset for a few weeks now, it was easy to set up - brand new condition - and much more lightweight in comparison to the Quest 1. (If using a Link cable) it also holds charge for a good few hours. Getting set up to play via the PC was a bit of a hasstle but once it has been it's now a very straightforward process. When in-game, the Oculus app is okay to use, not the best but it's easy to figure out. Sometimes the loading screens between games/steam/virtual desktop can lag/jitter, this is something to get use to. The main downside to this product is the strap quality. It's awful and very uncomfortable. I had to buy an alternative strap to make this wearable. For the price, I would have expected a much better quality strap to come with the product. The face visors are also not the best. The sponge one causes skin burn and soaks up sweat making it very unhygienic. The silicon one although easier to clean is very hard and does cause some strain. Again, I would reccomend buying a soft padded face visor for this item. I've done this and it makes wearing time much more pleasent! If purchasing for a young person/child, due to weight and comfort I highly recommend buying a better (weighted) head strap and face visor. Overall, it's a very good product, much better than the Quest 1, great charging hold, and lost of great games to enjoy!","laurie, 25 - 34, Bristol",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z

341,Great VR entry,Bought the headset a few weeks ago and have been enjoying playing Oculus exclusives but also linking to my pc. Oculus' air link ability is by far the best feature. Being able to connect to my gaming PC and stream the video to my headset whilst being in a different room is amazing. Removes tripping over wires and also allows you to go to a bigger room to play. Oculus' pass through video is handy for looking at your surroundings without having to take the headset off. Overall decent entry headset and is not much different to VR headsets that cost up to £1000,"ocook, 18 - 24, Wiltshire",2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z

My only complaints are the battery life which can be solved by a powrbank or a cable connected to the VR headset, otherwise this headset is great, but it's really worth it in the long run.

My wife is t a gamer at all but the oculus has changed her and she’s more obsessed with me. This is also helping us lose weight which is a major plus because you’re having fun at the same time!

371,Not sure its 100% new,"Item arrived when then they stated it would but I noticed when I went to set it up it had stickers on saying opened for inspection, the device already had an account (local) setup on it. that being said the stickers did say it had been inspected so maybe the account that was on it was there just to check it. That being said the headset works and so far no issues. battery life leaves something to be desired but with a fast charge battery bank in my back pocket and a cable (usb c to usb c) running to the headset I'm getting 5 or so hours play time. The quest 2 is perfect for a starter headset and with a decent wireless router in house using airlink makes it completely wireless (unless your using a battery bank for extended game play), I would highly recommend buying the virtual desktop from the oculus market place instead of using Steam VR as Steam VR can be temperamental and very buggy.","Robert, 25 - 34, Cumbria, UK",2022-03-08T00:00:00.000Z

398,Great quality for reasonable price!,"After month of use I can say its brilliant quality. Video and sound quality are really high standard, where the price is reasonable so we could afford it.

399,Bought mostly to play VR Steam games.,"Got this a while back to play VR Steam games (costed me an extra £15 for the software). Since its not designed for that it was a bit hard to set up due to the few extra stept you need to take on the device, on your phone AND on your PC. If used as intended as a standalone device its extremely easy to set up and use. Device works great, battery life is roughly 2.5-3 hours which is not bad but the device has one dealbraking issue. The strap is unbearably unconfortable for more than 15 minutes at a time since it ""holds it in place"" by pushing the device on your face. No matter how tight i make it it still slides and moves, and for that reason I had to buy a new strap and it lools like it was designed for people to buy the elite version. Opted for one that was not made by oculus since the Elite strap still pushes the device on your face even tho its more secure. Other than that, 100% would recommend. Also amazing for watching netflix on a big screen in a virtual cinema!","Johnny, 25 - 34, Scotland",2022-02-27T00:00:00.000Z

402,Hmmmmmm,"I must say as an adult I was just as excited to get this as my 14yr old son, after two weeks I’m now bored of it. Unless you are connecting to a gaming PC the graphics and game selection is poor. Battery life is around one hour.","Andy, 35 - 44, Wigan",2022-02-24T00:00:00.000Z

412,Great fun entering the metaverse!,"Fantastic Oculus quest 2. The video viewing experience is great but I spend most of my time gaming - which helps me be active! Although a high price, it is definitely worth it! The safety features of creating a virtual zone is great and I avoid bumping into anything around me. What could be improved is the battery life (normally 2 hours or so of gaming) although this helps you to take regular breaks from it.","GC, 25 - 34, Leeds",2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z

414,Brilliant quality head VR head set,Quality head set but would recommend the Quest 2 elite head strap for longer playing times. Argos was the only store that actually had the head set in and I was fed up others saying they was getting them in but advertised on their site they were in? Perhaps it might have been the voucher I had for the store at the time but couldn’t because of transit issues ??

427,Great product at a great price,"For those looking to delve into the world of VR this is probably the best headset to go for. The setup is easy and intuitive. The resolution is great. The battery life is around 2 hours, which helps keep you from being immersed for long periods, although this can be extended by adding an elite strap with battery. One negative point I have to add is that you are required to have a facebook account to use this product. Not everybody uses facebook Mark!","Joe90, 45 - 54, Glasgow",2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z

452,You NEED one of these!!!,"I have always been a gamer, but like most as I got older I had less time for it and felt guilty for any unhealthy time wasted in front of a screen. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER! With the quest you get to enjoy escapism in games, while on your feet and maybe even getting a little excercise! The standalone nature of the quest means setting up is a breeze, and getting into a game now takes moments. The games are so creative and a lot of them are online and highly social. The non game experiences are phenomenal too. From exploring the International Space Station, took goin on an adventure with Blue the raptor from Jurassic World. To sitting in a cinema watching films in 3D on a huge screen. All from the safety of your home! Honestly this product gives you souch for your money, totally recommended.","Real_ASP_Sy, 35 - 44, Somerset",2022-02-10T00:00:00.000Z
453,Great kit for all VR needs,"I brought this on the recommendation of my son. Moving from the PSVR I wasn’t expecting too much. I stand corrected the features and games that they have on the quest is countless hours of fun and can even help you with your organisation. You can wether wirelessly or wired connect this to a VR ready computer and play the entire steam library and more through this headset. If your looking for an affordable route to join the VR universe than this is for you. Also finger tracking, did I mention you don’t even need the controllers. Lastly the battery, it lasts a good 2/3 hours in the headset and a couple of weeks in the handsets. Battery’s are included in controllers.","GhostUk, 35 - 44, eastleigh",2022-02-10T00:00:00.000Z

458,A great VR headset,"Its user friendly, works well as a stand alone or on PC using Oculus Link and Steam VR Software. Remotes are easy to use and maintain grip while pressing the buttons and triggers.

461,"Great features, terrible battery","I pondered for weeks whether to buy this. I researched the battery life etc and found it should last around 6-8hours, however in reality its died after 2-3 most.

488,Amazing how far VR has come,"I bought this expecting a basic VR experience. The VR itself and the games are so much more immersive than I thought they would be. There are tonnes of options for everyone in the game store and app lab. The battery time isn't the best (about 1 hour) but it does charge very quickly and you can buy straps with battery extenders built in. The guardian wall really makes this oculus stand out about anything else, it gives you a safe space in your home that you can move around in. Highly recommended.","Smithcraig88, 25 - 34, Leicester",2022-02-06T00:00:00.000Z

493,Immersive,"Bought this after playing on a friends. The main selling point for me was that it’s a self contained system, no need for a console of pc. You just need an internet connection. There’s a huge range of games available online and other immersive experiences. Battery life is around 3 to 4 hours depending on what your doing. It’s a brilliant piece of kit, even my 70 year old dad loves it as he can go on virtual holidays without needing to leave the house.","PieRomancer, 35 - 44, Tunbridge wells",2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z
494,VR - it's the future!,"I love this VR headset, the games are really fun and engaging. The Quest 2 is at a great price point. Can't recommend enough! Wish they do it in black to make it more dirt and dust proof and connecting to a PC could be better. Don't like having to use a cable for that. However it still looks sleek and the option of running Steam VR is very cool.","Andy, 25 - 34, Cambridge",2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z

501,Fantastic experience,After gaming for over 20 years of my life. I have to say Vr has been a revolutionary experience. It has opened somany possibilities.

502,Just a load of fun really,"I finally got one and I gotta say this thing is just fun especially with other people, the only downsides I would say are the fact that the additional things for the headset such as the cable for oculus link and the other attachments are expensive but you can find alternatives with a bit of looking","K, 18 - 24, Bolton",2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z
503,"Oculus itself is great, but connecting to PC…","Oculus headset is great, the app store it comes with has some good games.

510,Honest review,"-The headstrap is fine, it doesnt feel too front heavy. -The battery life is fine, I get tired after one hour anyway -Any USB 3 rated for transfer can be used, don't buy the official one -Use a referral link to get store credit -The TOS is iffy but soon it should change as the Facebook account requirement is going to be removed","Jack101, 18 - 24",2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z
511,"Portable, fun gaming gear","Bought this for some family fun and everybody uses it at home. Great picture and features. portability is a bonus without the need for a console.

529,It's mediocre,"First things first, you are forced to have a Facebook account and this is a major negative right from the start. The headset strap is very uncomfortable and the battery is shocking, it takes hours to charge and you only get a 2 or so hours play time. Now I know you can buy a elite strap and battery but this should be standard for the price, not an additional sell. The elite strap and battery do work and makes it comfortable and gives you approx 4 to 5 hours. The other negative is the headset gets hot, sometimes it's so hot I can feel the heat on my eye balls drying them out. Personally for me the resolution is no great and although there is no screen door effect, instead that's replaced with just as annoying ring door effect where you can see rings that make it unclear and crisp to the eye. The good thing is that it is enjoyable to use once you use sidequest to increase resolution and performance, you can even install retro games like Half Life and Doom 3 in VR using side quest. I really like Resident evil 4 VR and some other games from Oculus. Oculus TV is rubbish the quality is like 420P on 360 videos, the best result is YouTube VR and Big screen for clarity. Overall, although fun to use, I still think VR is a long way off in terms of a good enjoyable experience that you can keep going back too. If I was to improve this it would be a better way to disperse heat, improve graphics massively and get rid of the rings that cause blurry vision as I have to constantly adjust the headset","Deacon, 25 - 34, Blackburn, Blackburn with Darwen, UK",2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z

538,Fantastic upgrade for anyone with an older VR set,"We had a go of a friends Quest 2 and we were able to compare it directly to our original HTC Vive. The difference was staggering. The Quest 2 has a fantastic screen, text is far more legible and the higher resolution is fantastic. It even works great using a cable or wireless connection to our PC for playing Steam VR games The only downside is that if you share the headset with a spouse, you might have to keep adjusting the headstrap, so we ended up trading in our HTC Vive for a second Quest 2!","Amy, 25 - 34, Wirral",2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z
539,Explosive,Ive seen the video clips on you tube but nothing can prepare you for what you will experiance once your in virtual reality,"Oldgit, 55 - 64",2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z

544,A whole new world,"This is the beginnings of so much fun , so realistic from drone footage as if you are sitting in the top of the drone. Game play can be quite scary, especially with headphones on though the speakers are great ! Great product and purchase","Andy, 45 - 54, Troon",2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z

548,Just Great,"Honestly the headset is everything it’s advertised to be. Very simple to set up, nice UI, and of course wireless. That’s what stands out from other headsets. It also has amazing surround speakers that feel like you’re wearing headphones when you’re really not. I find that part quite interesting to say the least. Just the fact that it’s capable of running all apps and games without a super computer rig just makes it fantastic.","ElGiorgio_H, 18 - 24, Birmingham, West Midlands",2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z

557,LOVE IT!!,"I bought this after my sister got one and its the best thing I've ever bought. Its not just for gaming, you can watch films and tv on a screen that's cinema size, its mind blowing. The gaming is great too, something for everyone, no matter your age or ability. I'd recommend it to anyone. The head strap is a bit uncomfortable but if you invest in a better one its well worth it","Ebonyuk72, 45 - 54, Kent, UK",2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z
558,Fantastic,"Bought this for my grandson’s birthday, never had so much fun in all my days, whole family can use it from 3/4 years to 100 worth every penny, must state though, some of the games can be a little pricey","maria, 55 - 64, merseyside",2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z

563,Very impressive!,"Quick review: Super impressive in terms of cost and functionality. Truly wireless. Good selection of games. Do bear in mind that as it is totally self contained, the default graphics are basic as are the games. There is an option to connect it to a pc for more high end gaming but obviously that has cost implications. If you have never tried VR before I think it is a great place to start.","HC, 45 - 54, LONDON",2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z
564,Brilliant,Brilliant. Having great time with it. Love everything about it.,"Linda, 55 - 64, North West",2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

566,Game changer!,I was amazed at just how good this is and how far gaming has evolved. Only thing with it is I can only play for short periods before feeling disoriented and dizzy for sometime after!,"Oak, 35 - 44, East sussex",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
567,Brilliant,This was bought for my grandson to take with him while away working and he loves it my grandaughter also has one and loves it too hours and hours of fun,"jackie, 55 - 64, glasgow",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
568,Very entertaining,Excellent bit of kit to keep everyone entertained. Very immersive. Only negative point is that you will need to purchase protective attachments for the lenses if you wear glasses as they will scratch. Only cost £8 on other sites but they are a nessasity if you want to keep it in good condition. Battery life isn't great but to be fair it's probably a good thing as ya would be on all day getting nothing done.,"Martin, 55 - 64, Consett",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z

581,Quality,Had it almost a month and love it. So many options to improve gameplay such as PC tethering or using side quest to access so many more games including free ones. Battery life could be better but an external battery pack can be purchased.,"Stephen, 25 - 34, Manchester",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z

590,Fantastic,I'm loving the oculus quest 2. It's so much fun! I can't recommend it enough. I will say the games aren't that big in terms of memory storage so don't feel like you need to fork out an extra £100 a get the bigger memory version the 128GB version is just fine :-),"TheCockneyViking, 25 - 34, Bristol",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
591,Great,Brought this as a late Christmas present and we are very pleased with it.,"Bubbles, 65 or over, Kent",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
592,Expands on the social side of VR gaming,"The oculus is really aimed at social gaming with the metavese on the horizon, devices such as the PSVR in contrast was aimed at traditional console gaming. The difference mainly is the built in mic and speakers, much of the game design has communication with other players being people you know or random players worldwide. Bear this in mind when purchasing for children as internet safety is important to police","Steeleyboy, 35 - 44, Kent",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
593,"Excellent,, loved it for what it is.",Brilliant so much fun. Don't get caught up in bad reviews etc. You pay for what you get. Enjoy it for what it gives you.,"Fab, 45 - 54",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
594,A NEW WORLD,This VR head set is everything I wanted it to be! The range of games for the quest 2 is fantastic as well as the power of the headset. Graphics could be improved on but nothing is perfect. Saying that I can also use the headset to play games on steam VR as well just with a click of a button. No wires attached. You can use a feature called airlink to hook it up to your PC to play steam VR games. I’ve been having a blast. Saying that I do believe that with the cable things might run a bit smoother if you don’t have the best internet in the world. All in all I think this headset is fantastic and would really recommend it to anyone!,"Hades1999, 18 - 24, Edinburgh",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
595,Perfect and fun,Son got one off Santa. They are that good I went and bought one for myself. Now me and my son have hours of fun bit off day and son time.

600,Great price for a standalone as well as pc vr,"I've been using the Quest 2 for almost a month now, as a standalone it is great as a pc vr it's even better. I own a psvr and the resolution and clarity with the Quest 2 is so much better. Its so packed full of features too, and the Oculus Store has so much to choose from, I'm stuck indoors all the time, so having this has definitely opened up the world for me. Love it","Gadgetman, 35 - 44, Portsmouth",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
601,A great deal of fun!,"This, combined with Beat Saber, proves to be a lot of fun and a surprisingly good workout at the same time. The unit is extremely clever and aside from the short battery life I really cannot fault it. Even then it isn’t that much of a problem. Get one. You won’t regret it.","Wrooty, 25 - 34, Farnborough",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z

609,Great Fun,"Bought for my son, who loves it. I had a go on a fishing game and it does give an amazing sense of 'reality'. Graphics are more akin to Nintendo Switch than Xbox / PS5, but good enough. The virtual barrier to prevent accidentally walking into things or punching the telly is a good addition (although not always failsafe, so leave plenty of space around you!). In terms of negatives, the headset is quite heavy and can be a little uncomfortable after a while. Otherwise great fun!","StevieBoy, 45 - 54, Hampshire",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z
610,Great product,"Works great, no issues so far","Tomas, 18 - 24",2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z

634,Good upgrade on the old Rift,Really happy with this. Upgraded from the Oculus Rift. Was worried about tracking without the desk sensors but this is so much better. Free to roam more around the house in different rooms. I've linked with PC app via AirLink and works fine for me but you need a really good WiFi setup. Only disappointment is lack of free games to play. Anything half decent in the Oculus store costs quite a bit. It would be good if they were a bit cheaper.,"Frog, 35 - 44",2022-01-15T00:00:00.000Z

I think an upgrade to a better strap is in order as I’ve heard the halo strap takes pressure of your forehead but that’s not taking away from what an amazing product this is!!,"Milesy, 45 - 54",2022-01-13T00:00:00.000Z

646,Brilliant all in one VR device,"I bought this product about 4/5 weeks ago & have not been disappointed at all, the Oculus 2 is an amazing immersive experience that really does feel like the technology has finally caught up & lived up to the promise of what virtual reality gaming & environmental exploration can deliver like movies from the 80s & 90s (lawnmower man/jonny nemonic) depicted fully immersive experiences where you not only feel like your within the gaming environment but done so well it allows you to be swept up in the narrative of the experience. There is absolutely nothing like being inside an actual game not being a puppet master of an on screen avatar but actually within a game allowing you to literally come face to face with iconic characters such as Darth Vader. There is nothing like it & frankly has to be the future of game play, there is also the fact it removes an aspect of gaming that worries parents that being the fact that people sit around playing games getting no exercises which is unhealthy the same can not be said for game play on the Oculus device every single time I remove the head set I'm flushed & outright sweating it marries the exercises elements of the Nintendo wii with the epic game play previously only found on xboxes or play stations this is an epic product I genuinely absolutely love.","Justin, 35 - 44, Birmingham West Midlands",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z

It’s really comfortable to wear and the controllers are easy to navigate.,"Chels96, 25 - 34, Milton Keynes",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z
650,Amazing,"I purchased this for my 11 year old for his big Xmas present....he had been saving up to buy himself so there were tears of joy on the day when he opened it. He has not stopped playing ever since, his best friend also received one for xmas so they regularly meet online and play the games together. Amazing graphics and interactive games lots of choice but you do have to pay for some of the additional games although there are lots for free. My son is drenched in sweat from the activities and games they play so it is giving him a workout unlike the PS/Xbox games he plays. The price seemed high but considering the amount of time he spends playing and the enjoyment he's getting as well as exercise I have no regrets and would reccomend","KC, 45 - 54, Surrey",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z

655,Wow,"This is easily the best purchase ever, including my car and house. I bought this for my son for Xmas but it would seem I am the kid of the house. I downloaded thrill of the fight boxing and I can't keep off it. Its the best exercise I have ever done its motivational and addictive because I don't like to lose. I've lost around 8 ibs in 2 weeks.

664,Best Buy in a long time,Bought for my grandson on the advice of a colleague. I was sceptical thinking it was a lot of money for a one day wonder but it’s definitely not been that- it’s in use every day and the whole family use it. Definitely a worthwhile Christmas present this year,"Elgee, 45 - 54, Lancashire",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z

666,Love this device!,"Bought as a family Christmas gift this year and so far the kids have been unable to step away from it in their downtime. The immersive experience provides a completely different level of gameplay and wider family members who have had a go have been blown away with the experience too. Controls are easy to use and there are a good number of features to stop you bumping into stuff. Battery time should be longer, but we have supplemented this with stuffing a standard powerbank in your pocket or on an elastic strap and plugging in a usb-c cable, which adds a good length of time to the battery life. It feels as though the kids are more physically active on this device compared to standard consoles. The range of games is good but could be broader - I guess that will come in time. Some of the games may give a bit of motion sickness, so try demos first before you buy and download any full games.","The Green One, 45 - 54, Reading, Berks",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z
667,Great fun!!!,"Bought the Oculus Quest 2 on recommendation from a friend & I’m so glad I did! It’s lots of fun, especially playing ‘Beat Saber’ with friends.

It's great my 7 year old plays it with little help needed and when my daughter plays it (5 year old) I can help her by casting what she see's on it to my t.v. I love it since Covid I been working from home and struggle to fit my time in to do exercise. Whilst playing games on here is like actually doing exercise. Great for the whole family!!","Rachykaty, 25 - 34, South Wales, Port Talbot",2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z

679,Almost there..,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present. He had an Oculus Rift before this. This is definitely an upgrade on the rift, with smooth, crisp graphics and of course the ability to use the headset as a wire free standalone device you can just take with you anywhere. However, there's a few negatives to mention. First off, you will need to get a better strap straight away. The strap supplied does not have enough support for the front- heavy headset and it is extremely uncomfortable to wear, as it drags down at the front of your face. The elite strap is very good (adjustable at the back with a dial). However, it's very expensive, especially the one with an extra battery pack at the back. The elite strap does secure the quest 2 nicely on the head though, and the battery pack at the back balances out the weight distribution a bit. I would also recommend getting a USB A to USB C (3.0) cable as you will probably want to play it wired at home and it doesn't come with any wired connections. Overall, this is a step in the right direction with VR. Not ground breaking if you already have a decent VR set. And unless you have all your games on the Oculus store, you may find you want to use the vr set wired.","Silkyways, 35 - 44, Middlesbrough",2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z

694,Pretty Solid,I didn't even know it hand motion sensors (which granted aren't the best) but it's refreshing to no see this type of ability shoved in your face My biggest problem with Quest 2 is how long the battery lasts. I understand why it doesn't last that long but it's annoying when the games I'm playing on start to get good when it gets to 10% left. I really recommend getting a battery pack for that longer gameplay,"owen, 18 - 24, Wolverhampton",2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z

726,"You'll go ""wow"" at least once","Pros: It's pretty easy to set up (there are useful 'how to get started' videos on YouTube) and to use. Once you've got it set up, you'll find some intros that take you through what it can do and how to use it. It comes with preloaded experiences and demo versions of games so you'll have stuff to keep you busy for a while (I've had mine three weeks and still haven't seen and done everything on it). There's a variety of things to do. Apart from games and fitness classes, I've been snowboarding, experienced a parachute jump, raced a motorbike and visited places I've never been before (plus a few I have). You'll go ""Wow"" at least once. Cons: Oculus is owned by Facebook and you need a facebook account to use it. You'll want to buy full versions of some of the games, as well as new stuff, and these are not cheap. It's a bit glitchy - it can freeze, for example - but most problems are resolved by restarting it (the Oculus website is quite useful, you can even chat to a real person). Spending hours in virtual reality might be a bit antisocial to people around you. Overall, I'm pleased with it and have used it nearly every day. If you've never experienced immersive VR before, you'll find it very different from anything else - including 3D. But that's what makes you go ""wow"".","Jez, 55 - 64, Kent",2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z

745,Super fun!,"Great bit of kit, purchased one as a 'family' present and everyone in the house is fighting over it haha. If you have never experienced vr be prepared to be blown away! The only possible negative for some is you have to register to one official facebook account, you have no choice but to do this, then it is locked in to that account and cannot be changed so won't suit everyone. Also the supplied strap whilst certainly useable can definately be improved upon with an aftermarket one of which there are plenty out there to choose from and there are many reviews on a popular website to help you decide should you wish to upgrade. Overall very happy with product and now considering buying another to stop the fighting haha:)","Antogga42, 45 - 54, Cheshire",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z

I love the games, love the quality, love that you can use it plugged in to watch YouTube, Netflix, etc etc. It's amazing!!! The battery lasts quite well, and there is an option to plug in a power pack while playing. The official version is great, but you can use any pack and a standard USB C. If you have a 90 Deg adaptor or specific wire, it's more comfortable, but any wire will work!","Nick, 35 - 44, Wales",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z

It is an incredible experience inside and i was quite amazed. 2 warnings - it is very easy to spend a lot of money very quickly by clicking on new games etc. and I felt very motion sick particularly when moving around an environment using the hand controls. Different for everyone I imagine but it was difficult for me. Also, remember you can return / refund any games etc u buy that you dont like. Overall, amaZing, and totally different.

768,Experiance will blow your mind!,We brought 2 of these for the kids as Christmas presents and they are over the moon. The adults have had equally as much fun. Even more so we can link it to the TV and see what the player is seeing. Highly recommend. Battery takes about 2 to 3 hours for a full charge amd last for a few hours. Some may think this is not good however I think you need to the break to be in the real world so you don't feel motion sickness. And gives kids that break instead of being stuck in the gaming world like other consoles,"Braley1107, 25 - 34, Lincolnshire",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z

810,Very good,This oculus quest all in one vr headset we should have got a fifty pound voucher with this offer I thought they would inbox me with this but they haven't we tried getting in touch with them but can't get through to speak to anyone .,"Colleen, 45 - 54, Hull",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z

812,Great Console,"I think it’s a brilliant console, however the graphics naturally are low, with the ps vr 2 coming out it pales in comparison, but as my first vr headset I couldn’t recommend it more. No wires are needed and it’s easy to set up, even my parents know how to use it!","McCann, 18 - 24, Buckinghamshire",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z
813,Better than expected,"Purchased as a gift for my son and he loves it. Parents notes: You have to have a Facebook account to connect to, and as my son doesn't have one yet, we have to use ours to login for him. And the game selection is still pretty limited and most everything has to be purchased. There aren't really any free titles, just demos that can be tried. So if this is purchased as a gift, make sure he has something set aside to purchase games right away. You can link it to your desktop computer, but this is a bit clunky at times and doesn't support everything. You can't just put it on and play fortnite or Minecraft. You need a link cable, sold separately, and a computer with decent specs to make this work. Aside from this, it's a great piece of technology but is still niche and they may tire of it quickly.","Dadpool, 35 - 44, Colchester",2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z
814,Once set up excellent,"Difficult to setup initially, not many free games available, all the good ones are to purchase via the oculus store and are quite expensive.

897,The next step in gaming - superb,"Bought the oculus as a family Xmas present, what an amazing bit of kit. Had to start a Facebook account but not a big deal, don't use Facebook just have an account. Our favourite game at the moment is crazy golf, it's just fantastic, feels like your really on the course even to the point of trying to step over things and lean over balustrades, funny to watch people when your not playing. Can't recommend it enough. Some if the fast paced experiences can make you a little dizzy like the roller coasters but you get used to it. We have found many free items to play and watch, the 911 experience is a real eye opener, from being in the streets of New York, watching the towers get hit from a witness on the day perspective was shocking, to hearing the story of the family its about, just amazing. Must get bit of kit, you can play games, watch films in imax there are 3d experiences which work really well, and lots of other things we have not even touched yet. Expensive but we'll worth it. The only downside is the battery in the headset only lasts about an hour, but I like that because it stops the kids playing for too long. Quick 2 hour recharge and your off again. Spent this morning looking around the great pyramid at gigs, amazing.","PAUL, 45 - 54, WILTSHIRE",2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z

905,Great gaming device,It’s a great device to be able to play games on independent from any other system. It’s nice not having all the cables like with the PS VR. Only downside is tracking can be a little off and the battery power does go down quite quick depending on the game you’re playing. I’d definitely recommend it though. My husband loved it as his surprise christmas present. One other thing to mention would be if you want to stream it to the Tv I would get a Google chrome cast. You can cast straight to the Tv then and they aren’t that expensive to buy in addition either.,"Suze, 25 - 34, Nottingham",2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z

952,Brilliant VR Headset,Purchased this as a Christmas present so am now able to leave a review. Brilliant bit of kit and fairly easy to set up but you do need to create a Facebook account to use it and purchase content. The games and other VR experiences are decently priced and if you do download a game and you don't like it you can claim a refund if you've used the content for less than two hours and you've requested a refund less than 14 days after purchase which is great. We have only downloaded free content so far so we can get used to the headset but what we have viewed/tried so far is great. You can also download the Netflix and Amazon Prime VR and watch content from those platforms if you have a subscription and it feels as though your actually in the cinema! Excited to explore further. Battery life is around 2 hours but you can purchase a battery pack that clips on the headstrap from 3rd party sellers if desired.,"Deano1960, 55 - 64, Lancashire, UK",2021-12-29T00:00:00.000Z

959,Best gadget I've bought,"Really happy with the fast and friendly delivery from Argos. Since getting the Oculus i find myself using it pretty much everyday. This gadget isn't only for kids, teenagers or men. I'm female aged 35 and have many uses for this, its also a way of escapism. The games are great and best part, you can ask for refund within reason for a game purchased as long as its within 2 hours of buying it. You get 2.5 to 3 hours of use on a full battery. I think my favorite use for this ...is the cinematic experience when watching shows on YouTube or online. Great buy!","Kristinasama, 35 - 44, London",2021-12-26T00:00:00.000Z

962,"Must have, for a beginner to veteran gamer.","This is an awesome VR headset. Facebook/Meta have packed so much tech into this fully wireless device. If you're interest in VR, whether it's simply just to explore what it has to offer or if you want to start with PCVR gaming this device can do it. The tiny android mobile chip in this thing is truly impressive and can perform really well on its own, but if you need more power and better graphics, you can wire up via USB-C or connect wirelessly (5ghz ONLY) to your PC to really experience VR. Tracking is fantastic and you don't need any additional equipment like most VR devices (such as trackers etc) Battery will last approx 2-3 hours but you can charge whilst you play, if you have a long enough USB-C Cable (cheap one from Amazon will suffice) Do yourself a favour and visit VR, you won't be disappointed, especially to impress family & friends.","Aaron, 25 - 34, Nottingham",2021-12-23T00:00:00.000Z

Opening said box made me feel like a child again, where playing with boxes was a wonderful past time. i gleamed to find my oculus perfectly situated inside, tightening my fist I shouted: “GOODBYE WORLD!” and ran upstairs giddy with excitement. The instruction manual was somewhat clear though I made sure to turn to Youtube for a fully optimised experience - adjusting the straps for comfort. I turned the device on VrooooOoooOom! Alas my first enermy, download times! After two hours I began playing with the device, purchased beat saber, watched some YouTube - I find my eyes get tired but it’s a cool escape","Holly, 18 - 24, United Kingdom, Chichester",2021-12-22T00:00:00.000Z

987,Big improvement from the original quest,"Having tried a friend's original quest I decided I wanted to get a VR headset for myself, and not having a gaming capable pc the quest obvious choice and it's great. Being able to have as large a play area as possible and not worrying about a tether is great and motion is far smoother on the quest 2 than the original (obviously a headset connected to a high end gaming pc will be smoother but for the majority of people who don't have one this is more plenty to enjoy). The only downside is having to login with a facebook account but that is going to come down to personal preference as to whether you are ok with that or not.","sabrina, 25 - 34",2021-12-22T00:00:00.000Z

I'm going to go visit Rome and some other capitols that I've never really fancied in real life . Great for excersice too. Only thing I would say is if you can try it before buying a some folk cannot cope and it makes them sickly . Saying that I thought I would be one of them but I'm loving it . I would buy another battery so you've got one charging and one playing .

1038,Simplifying the complex VR world,"I bought this after a month or so researching VR. There were so many things I thought I had to worry about when it came to VR, like setting up sensors or ensuring I had a PC that was built for heavy gaming. No. The Quest 2 is amazingly simple, you can play it right out of the box. I was able to play the games I wanted to play with my friends, and all in a matter of minutes. If you are the techy type, there are ways to connect your Oculus to your PC and Steam, so that will increase your options in terms of games to play. The only downsides I've noticed are the strap gets uncomfortable after a while, and the battery life is quite poor. I would recommend also going for the accessories if you plan to spend longer hours on the Quest 2.","moejkt, 18 - 24, Huddersfield",2021-12-15T00:00:00.000Z

1052,Amazing,Blown away by how cool this is and how much content that is available for the device.

1053,The best thing I’ve ever bought!,"After trying out virtual reality 2 years ago, I have wanted my own ever since. I finally made the decision and bought one this year before Christmas to guarantee some funny moments with the family and I am so happy I did! Virtual reality is definitely an out of this world experience that I believe everyone has to try at least once! This Oculus is the best option as it is wireless with battery life of around 2 hours, has 3 different lenses that you can click through on the goggles to match each persons eyesight so it’s not blurry, you can cast your experience to another device so your friends/family can also experience it too, has a large store of many games to buy and a few that are even free, and tons of video experiences; my favourite so far being walking alongside Blue from Jurassic World and seeing a T-Rex. If you’re thinking about buying, it’s definitely worth it!","kaypurchases, 18 - 24, Bournemouth, England",2021-12-15T00:00:00.000Z
1054,Perfect if you don't own a pc and it's fun to use,When I got the vr I was so excited to use and I would rate it a 10 out of 10 especially the games on there.

1064,So much better than I expected,"I didn’t expect to really enjoy VR (it was for my husband), but after trying several games it’s really a great experience. Even The Room, which is a mystery game, is amazing to experience. Only thing I’ve found is the weight of it can make your neck ache and it’s heavy around your eyes and will leave marks. Plus, if you wear glasses, do use them with it to prevent eye strain .","AbiC, 25 - 34, Chester",2021-12-15T00:00:00.000Z

1089,"Awesome, fun, fantastic","Bought it about a month ago and it is honestly a great way to play vr. I play vr on different things such as playstation and steam and this one is up there purely due to having no wires, it just makes you feel so much more free to do anything you wish to do. There can be frame rate drops depending on the game but a lot of the time you don't even notice. I couldn't recommend this more to people who are experienced with vr or people who are just starting and want a good starting point. If you do get however, get the elite strap with battery to ensure you can play longer as you can play for hours without realising.","ThickKevin, 18 - 24, Stockport",2021-12-12T00:00:00.000Z

1093,Great gaming experience.,Bought for my 14 year old son. We already have VR for PlayStation and I really enjoy that except the wires can ruin the experience. So getting the Quest was a great next step. Not quite as comfortable as the psvr and games not quite as developed in my view. Controllers are better than psvr and lack of wires add to appeal. Ordered new head strap to help with comfort. Hoping that will help. Overall very pleased and hope to get some great games on it soon.,"Andyl189, 45 - 54, Manchester",2021-12-12T00:00:00.000Z

1103,New to VR and blown away!,"I am in the custom AV installation business, so get to see a lot of TV displays and projectors. Sure, very different to VR, but the Quest 2 screens produce clear ""chicken wire"" free bright and colourful images. Your mind will process whatever you give it, and with the right video or games, I found myself immersed into something extraordinary. Remember, this is a relatively cheap Headset, but in my opinion worth many times the price tag!","Pacman, 55 - 64, East Sussex",2021-12-08T00:00:00.000Z
1104,"Blown away, stopped using my PS5 completely!","I've been debating whether to buy a quest for myself for a while and recently gave in to that temptation, and honestly I'm so glad I did. The ability to chuck on the headset without having to plug any wires in is fantastic. Unlike my PSVR I can literally just carry the Quest to a friend's house and start playing. The only downside is that the casting option cast be a bit hit or miss, but other than that I'm super happy with my purchase! Absolutely recommend it!","Jay, 25 - 34, Kent",2021-12-08T00:00:00.000Z

1128,Awesome product,"This is my second vr headset and I have to say it is truly awesome, the fact that it can be used as a standalone device makes a huge difference when comparing to other vr headsets, the stock headstrap is not particularly comfortable so I would recommend getting the pro headstrap if you will be playing for longer amounts of time","Boondoggle, 25 - 34",2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z

1133,Love it!,"Been playing with this every day since I bought it, amazing product. It is scary how ""real"" it makes everything feel. The main negatives are: - Requires facebook account to use it. - The battery life is about 2-3hours which we antipicated but it is slightly annoying..for the longer gaming sessions. (so you can either go the wired route or get external battery chargers and strap them to your headset to extend battery life) - The headset strap is never fully comfortable, it either pulls the headset up when you look down, or is too tight around your eyes/forehead and you have to find a ""middle ground"" between the two. Looking to get another third party strap. Ultimately though, very pleased with this....so pleased that we're now buying a second one for the partner!","Bob27, 25 - 34, Kent",2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z

1142,Amazing,"This is an amazing bit of kit, if your thinking about purchasing one you will not be disappointed, I just can’t believe how good it is! Playing VR games is the next level, I don’t think I will ever look at a games console again! Playing games, watching 3D films or playing against your friends is just amazing! All my friends that have tried my VR headset are now looking to purchase one for Christmas, they are that good! i’m just gutted I didn’t get one sooner!! You must have a facebook account for this to work so they don’t recommend anyone under the age of 13 years of age to use it!","Daniel, 35 - 44, Wellingborough",2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z
1143,It's the future,"I purchased the oculus quest 2 from Argos and haven't been able to put it down since, decent set of games available to purchase on the built-in store hook it up to a decent computer and the possibilities are endless, a must have for any true gamer","Valor 64, 25 - 34, Staffordshire",2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z

Buy it but if your big into games go for the 256gb version!,"Layt69, 35 - 44, Leicestershire",2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z
1150,Ready for the metaverse,Oculus Quest 2 is simply the best VR headset in the market. Comfortable enough (with glasses you need to adjust a bit) and seamless user experience. In combo with the rigid case (that I purchased separately) is a cool gift idea as well.,"null, 35 - 44, London",2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z
1151,Must try experience - be wary of motion sickness,A very surreal experience that I highly recommend trying. Some games caused me to experience motion sickness so I can only use it in short bursts - something to consider before purchase,"louiT, 18 - 24, London",2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z
1152,Better than expected!,This is my first ever VR headset and honestly it’s actually really good and Emersive. You can definitely get lost of time and where you are standing with these. Quiet durable for the price and quite reasonable for all the qualities. Sadly though the games are expensive,"MxL Ninjaz, 18 - 24, Herefordshire",2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z

1157,Wireless is the way forward !,"As a former rift s owner (and big fan of resident evil 4 - quest 2 exclusive) I upgraded to this model and couldn't be happier. No more screen door effect , 120 hz when using link cable on pc, wireless... even the controllers are nicer. All this , and it was cheaper than what I bought my rift s for. This is a no brainer! Pair this with a after market face cover ( I got a vrcover one) and you really do have one of the best in class vr headsets for sure.","Robsip, 25 - 34, Newport",2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z

1160,"Fantastic VR, no wires",I had a Oculus Rift a couple years back and thought that was great but this is miles ahead of that and with no wires and no computer required! Amazing clarity and no issues with performance. The games I have tried so far have had no issue with performance and the tracking of the controllers is near perfect. Would 100% recommend.,"Cameron, 25 - 34, Reading",2021-11-13T00:00:00.000Z

1164,Virtually perfect!,A great VR system that allows the user to play wirelessly or connected to a PC. The battery life offers around 2 hours alone but it can be plugged in the a power bank or PC to play longer. I’d say this is 100% with the money but the current strap is rather uncomfortable,"Jord, 18 - 24, England, UK",2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z
1165,Amazing,Exceeded my expectations. I used to own a GearVR headset by Samsung. After this was EOL I wanted to try a purpose built VR headset. It's great! Battery life could be a bit better but it's definitely fit for purpose. Some great games and features. You can set up your own boundary guardian so you don't walk into things in real life which is good as its easy to be fully immersed in VR. Would recommend taking frequent breaks as you can feel nauseous depending on what game your playing.,"RyanD, 25 - 34, Manchester",2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z

1175,Great VR headset,"Good quality VR headset, good build, comfortable for both kids and adults. The range of available apps is not great yet and the paid ones are quite expensive, but I think this will improve with time as the technology is adopted more.

1179,Brilliant!,"I bought this as a present for myself on my Birthday and it is incredible! This is my first VR headset and I've been loving the experience so far. The set-up was very easy and straightforward to do and after that it's just a case of using it. This product is really good as it works as a stand-alone product, you don't need a computer to play VR games, you can download and play them directly from the headset. If however you wish to connect to a pc the wireless airlink works just fine, I know oculus says you should buy a link cable (not included) but provided you have a decent WiFi connection (5GHz) the airlink streams games directly from your pc to the headset with little to no noticeable delay or quality loss.","david, 18 - 24, Glasgow",2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z
1180,Sadly I can’t review it as it’s a gift,I can’t review this but Argos keep pressuring me to leave a review. It was a gift and as far as I know it was welcomed.,"FairyGodmother, 45 - 54, Hampshire",2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z
1181,Amazing,"Fantastic bit of kit!!!! So easy to setup, even had it showing on my TV when friends where around so I didn't look to strange. Downside is the Facebook integration but you can turn off a lot of settings so you can play in peace. Sideloader will become your best friend! The basic strip that comes with it is very uncomfortable so I would recommend buying a better one. Best purchase of the year!!!","Neilthegay, 35 - 44, Paignton",2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z

Bit of a pain that you need an additional bit of software (virtual desktop app) to use it with steam if you don’t want to be wired, but it’s worth the extra minor cost to use my other games.","Viksteel, 35 - 44, Durham",2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z
1191,Resident Evil 4 IS MUST HAVE!,"Absolutely amazing, the lenses are crystal clear, a huge step up from my previous headset, the psvr.. which to say the least, ps1 graphics, motion sickness, it was a grainy mess...","Graham, 25 - 34, Accrington",2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z

Love the games on this, resolution is pretty good, half life Alyx is mindblowing. Great fun so far, better on days where you haven't already been using screens :-), only downside is that it relies on Facebook servers for no good reason!","Amon, 35 - 44, brighton",2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z
1193,Amazing gaming machine,"This is a brilliant piece of kit, lots and lots to do.. You don't realise how good it is until you actually use it.

Couldnt tell you any difference between other vr headsets on the market but totally impressed with yhis. Only downside is the amount of battery life.

1263,Great tech for a great price!,"I bought myself this VR as a gift after a failed spinal surgery. I ended up needing a wheelchair for journeys longer than my street. I felt my sense of adventure extinguished due to being confined at home more. Once I purchased the Oculus Quest 2, it opened up a whole new world for me to go and explore, pretty much life-changing. It connects to your phone to add apps like google earth, which I love as I can explore the world in an instant in 360. It has so many social apps and games so I don't feel cut off from the world anymore. Despite being stand-alone, wireless pick up and play, also it will connect to a decent spec gaming PC and use the processing power and gfx so you can play higher spec games and connect to steam. I recommend this to anyone starting out wanting VR because what you get for the price is astonishing. 10/10","DarlinFace, 35 - 44, warrington",2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z

1285,Amazing product,"Not very comfortable, but absolutely amazing to pass the time with. I've loved spending time with my friends in the games that are available. The battery life isn't very long, but that's OK, I don't use the full battery life in one ru anyway. The controllers are very easy to use, and the buttons are spaced apart just right.","A277353, 18 - 24, Scarborough, North Yorkshire",2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z
1286,Great buy,I bought this for my sons birthday he was over the moon,"Gem, 35 - 44, London",2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z
1287,Great fun!,"More fun than I expected. Teen loves it too. Would like more battery life but otherwise, brilliant.","Missb, 35 - 44, Glasgow",2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z
1288,Horrendous sickness,The quality of the product was great but after using it i suffered horrendous motion sickness and dizziness. This lasted for hours after playing. Ive used PS VR before but never suffered as much with that.,"Adfsad, 35 - 44",2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z
1289,Brilliant,Excellent piece of kit. Had hours of fun.,"Bill, 55 - 64, Nottingham",2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z
1290,As good as expected,"Bought this a month ago, still learning the ropes but very impressive tech.","Les, 55 - 64, Lincs",2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z
1291,Great features very good,My teenage son is very pleased with his present,"Bennett, 65 or over, Tenby, UK",2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z
1292,It is ok,The only problem my son has is setting up though Facebook and if he forgets his password than he get lock out of his account for 24 hours very annoying,"Claire, 35 - 44, Bicester",2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z
1293,Amazing performance-great fun,"I bought this about a month ago and I haven’t put it down since, 100% worth the buy","Sig22, 18 - 24, Bridgend",2021-09-25T00:00:00.000Z
1294,Lovely device for gamers or those wanting to relax,"I bought this as a replacement for the Quest 1 which recently broke. Compared to the Quest 1, the build quality is inferior but this is balanced by the display quality which is noticeably better. If you have never used a VR headset before, don't expect immersion like you've seen in films as we are a few years away from spending your life in a new, exciting fun filled world. What you do get is an introduction into what will come. Many people complain that any VR headset makes their neck or head ache. This is usually down you not adjusting it correctly and there are tones of YouTube clips on how to do this right. Many people sweat where the visor meets the face but i just wipe my visor with moist wipes to keep it clean. Motion sickness effects lots of new owners and has forced many to get rid of their headset, but you can train your sensors to ignore the discrepancy between your balance and eyes. If you run 'calm' apps until you have adjusted then most people can overcome the motion sickness in a couple of weeks. Jump straight into the roller-coaster and you'll struggle. when you start to feel ill, you need to stop straight away as you will not be able to push through it. It will win every time. There are accessories you can buy for this VR headset but the only one i have is an external battery holder which i 3D printed myself. This gives added play time and, as its attached to the back strap, it's a counterweight for the headset which helps with neck pain. I have been a video games since space invaders and Atari but i was blown away when i tried my first VR headset and would encourage anyone to try it. There are relaxation apps which have been a godsend during isolation and exercise apps which will put you through your paces. For the price, £100 cheaper than the Quest 1 was, this is such a useful device.","Rob, 45 - 54, Notts",2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z
1295,I love this item,"I’m so happy I bought the quest 2, it’s portable light and easy to carry. I would only with it had a longer battery life","foxinbox, 18 - 24, Farnham",2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z
1296,Outstanding Service!,I purchased this Headset as a birthday gift. It's amazing. Very clear graphics and long lasting battery.,"Gertie, 45 - 54, Leicestershire",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1297,Great and easy to use,Very happy about it!,"Sj, 18 - 24",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1298,Excellent gaming,My son and husband are loving this and the rest of the family have also enjoyed some game time,"Fi, 45 - 54, suffolk",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1299,Works brilliant,More fun than it looks haven't played anything else in weeks,"Blankxyy, 18 - 24, Salisbury Wiltshire",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1300,Innovation of VR Gaming,"I bought this at the start of September, and have used it most days since. Playing without any wires enhances gameplay more than you may think - and speaking of gameplay, the Oculus store has plenty of fantastic games to try out. Even if you aren't much into gaming, the Oculus store offers applications such as streaming apps and virtual experiences. Really fantastic system for newcomers into the VR world!","wilko, 18 - 24, Winsford, Cheshire",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1301,Great Purchase,"Great game, we love it","Liz, 25 - 34, Southport",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1302,Great VR product!,This is an affordable VR headset that can run applications from the headset without connecting it to a PC. Connection to PC is also possible via USB cable or wifi to run Steam VR games installed on the PC. Great product,"Zennek, 45 - 54, Ealing",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1303,You will not believe how good it is,"I was sceptical about buying this item but after purchasing it, even the demos that you can download look amazing on this, nice and clear pictures so long as you don’t wear glasses that are too big for the body because they catch on the side but apart from that it’s a very good system and the added ability to connect to a PC wirelessly as long as your PC meets the minimum requirement so you can enjoy VR from Services like steam Downside you have to tie it to a Facebook account and that being in good standing otherwise they can lock the system down. Also please note you will suffer from motion sickness for so long until you get used to it and you should take a rest every 20 minutes and let your eyes re-focus on normal things so you don’t damage your eyes. The motion sickness depends on the game if there is a lot of movement then your brain can’t cope with it. There is ways around this and it takes some learning","Jason73, 45 - 54, Mexborough",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1304,Awesome gaming,Excellent new brand of gaming,"Sayer, 35 - 44, Ilford",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1305,Virtually perfect,I bought this as a present for my partner who absolutely loves it.,"Sian, 18 - 24, Tamworth",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1306,"Fun device, Abut not for everyone!","Great fun for my son, but instantly gave my daughter and I motion sickness. It does say this in the blurb, but it affected the two of us quite badly. My son loves it though, so as long as you have plenty of space to move around I’m told it’s brilliant!","Mathcornish, 45 - 54, West Sussex",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1307,Great family fun,"My 8 year old autistic son loves to play with his occulus it gives him some sensory input and gives me some piece when hes playing lol. Occulus is also a great family adventure fun game from virtual reality car racing to shooting targets and many great brain training and competitive games it's a good choice for family fun times. ;,)","Argosprobuyer, 25 - 34, Liverpool",2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
1308,"Not bad, not bad at all","I bought this as I bought the Rift S... Turns out their last patch stopped the use of USB C adaptors... I had to buy a Quest 2. I am not disappointed. Very good non PC-VR kit. However, Oculus software is a bit rubbish.","ahyman1990, 25 - 34, Manchester",2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z
1309,Worth it,Have been waiting to get an Xbox series X. But after it’s taken so long I decided to try the world or VR without a Pc. Great for those into gaming and those who aren’t. My other half uses it for escape rooms. Downside is that streaming drops out often abs you can only export videos via Facebook which isn’t useful.,"Rob, 25 - 34, Chelmsford",2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z
1310,Great feature,Is very nice game to play m very happy thank to argos,"Nauman, 25 - 34, London Walthamstow",2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z
