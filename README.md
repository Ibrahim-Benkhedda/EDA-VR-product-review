# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Meta Quest 2 Product Reviews
<b> Abstract: </b> </br>
This study aims to analyze the sentiment and identify the main topics discussed in Meta Quest 2 product reviews scraped from the Argos website. To achieve this goal, we first preprocessed the reviews by removing unwanted characters and applying text normalization techniques. Then, we applied sentiment analysis using a machine learning classifier to classify the reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Finally, we used topic modeling to identify the main themes discussed in the reviews. The results of the sentiment analysis showed that a majority of the reviews were positive, while the topic modeling revealed that the main topics discussed included the product's features, gameplay, and overall satisfaction. We also visualized the results using word clouds and bar plots. This study provides valuable insights into the opinions and experiences of Meta Quest 2 customers and can help the manufacturer to improve the product.
